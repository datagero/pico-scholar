32026567,"Food environment near schools and body weight-A systematic review of associations by race/ethnicity, gender, grade, and socio-economic factors.","Mika Matsuzaki, Brisa N Sánchez, Maria Elena Acosta, Jillian Botkin, Emma V Sanchez-Vaznaugh","Previous research reported modest associations between food environments near schools and adiposity among children overall. The associations within sociodemographic subgroups have not been synthesized. This review assessed the evidence on the associations between food environments near schools and childhood obesity within different demographic and socio-economic subgroups. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to identify studies published in English between January 1, 1980, and April 25, 2019, examining the presence of fast food outlets, convenience stores, supermarkets, and grocery stores near schools and measures of overweight/obesity by race/ethnicity, gender, grade, and income level. Twelve cross-sectional and two ecological studies were included. Fast food outlets were most commonly examined (n = 12). The associations between fast food outlets near schools and obesity were generally positive among Latino, white, and African American students and across grade levels, although the strengths of evidence varied. The directions of association were mixed among Asian children. Three studies reported generally positive associations between convenience stores and obesity among Latino and African American children and mixed associations among white and Asian children. Longitudinal studies are needed in addition to studies examining underlying mechanisms of the differential influence of food environments near schools within each subgroup.",2020,Menon_2022,1

31989413,Maternal mycotoxin exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes: a systematic review.,"Nicholas N A Kyei, Daniel Boakye, Sabine Gabrysch","Mycotoxin exposure from food occurs globally but is more common in hot humid environments, especially in low-income settings, and might affect pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to synthesize the evidence from epidemiological studies on the relationship between maternal or fetal exposure to different mycotoxins and the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Multiple databases were systematically searched up to December 2018 to identify studies that assessed the association between mycotoxin exposure in pregnant women or fetuses and at least one pregnancy outcome. Studies were appraised and results were synthesized using standard methods for conducting systematic reviews. This review identified and included 17 relevant studies. There is some evidence to suggest that exposure to various Aspergillus mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxin) during pregnancy may impair intrauterine fetal growth and promote neonatal jaundice. Findings were inconclusive concerning the influence of aflatoxin exposure on perinatal death and preterm birth. Only two studies assessed effects of maternal exposure to Fusarium mycotoxins (e.g., fumonisin) on adverse pregnancy outcomes. These studies found that maternal fumonisin exposure may be associated with hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy and with neural tube defects. Studies using grain farming and weather conditions as a proxy measure for mycotoxin exposure found that such exposure was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and late-term miscarriage. In conclusion, there is already some evidence to suggest that exposure to mycotoxins during pregnancy may have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes. However, given the limited number of studies, especially on effects of Fusarium mycotoxins, more studies are needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of different mycotoxins on maternal and fetal health and to guide public health policies and interventions.",2020,Menon_2022,1
30696940,Neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal vitamin D in humans: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Azahara M García-Serna, Eva Morales","Diverse studies have investigated the impact of prenatal exposure to vitamin D levels on brain development; however, evidence in humans has never been systematically reviewed. This article summarized evidence of the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels in maternal blood in pregnancy or newborn blood at birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, including cognition, psychomotor performance, language development, behavioral difficulties, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autistic traits. PubMed, Web of Science and SCOPUS databases were systematically searched for epidemiologic studies published through May 2018 using keywords. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. Of 260 identified articles, 25 were included in the present review. Comparing the highest vs. the lowest category of prenatal 25(OH)D levels, the pooled beta coefficients were 0.95 (95% CI -0.03, 1.93; p = 0.05) for cognition, and 0.88 (95% CI -0.18, 1.93; p = 0.10) for psychomotor development. The pooled relative risk for ADHD was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.59, 0.89; p = 0.002), and the pooled odds ratio for autism-related traits was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.25, 0.71; p = 0.001). There was little evidence for protective effects of high prenatal 25(OH)D for language development and behavior difficulties. This meta-analysis provides supporting evidence that increased prenatal exposure to 25(OH)D levels is associated with improved cognitive development and reduced risk of ADHD and autism-related traits later in life. Associations represent a potentially high public health burden given the current prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency among childbearing aging and pregnant women.",2020,Menon_2022,1

32316194,Respiratory and Allergic Effects in Children Exposed to Pesticides-A Systematic Review.,"Rafael Junqueira Buralli, Amana Freitas Dultra, Helena Ribeiro","Pesticide exposure may affect children's respiratory and allergic health, although results from epidemiological studies have not reached consensus. This review aims to analyze the scientific evidence on respiratory and allergic effects of exposure to agricultural pesticides in children aged up to 12 years old. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, Scielo, and Lilacs were screened to select articles published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese, and 21 articles were included in this review. Most investigations were conducted in North America (mostly in the United States), while no studies conducted in Latin America or Africa were found, despite their intensive use of pesticides. Children are exposed to pesticides through multiple pathways from the prenatal period throughout later developmental stages and may experience several respiratory effects. Most studies (79%) found positive associations with pesticide exposure and children's respiratory and allergic effects such as asthma, wheezing, coughs, acute respiratory infections, hay fever, rhinitis, eczema, chronic phlegm, and lung function impairments. Contrastingly, 21% of the studies found no associations between pesticide exposure and children's respiratory health. The vast differences among the characteristics of the studies hamper any comparison of the results. Exposure to pesticides may have several impacts on childhood respiratory health. More studies must be conducted, especially in low- and middle-income countries, preferably with comparable research protocols adapted to local realities. Efforts should be made to develop comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and behavioral interventions to reduce children's exposure to pesticides used in agriculture and respiratory health effects, and to ensure healthy childhood growth.",2020,Menon_2022,1
32283742,Association between Female Reproductive Health and Mancozeb: Systematic Review of Experimental Models.,"Serena Bianchi, Stefania Annarita Nottola, Diana Torge, Maria Grazia Palmerini, Stefano Necozione, Guido Macchiarelli","Mancozeb is a widely used fungicide approved for use in agriculture in many countries with long persistence in the environment and consequent bioaccumulation in tissues and biological fluids. Despite the large amount of studies published in recent years, the relationship between mancozeb exposure and female reproductive health is not fully elucidated. In order to summarize current evidence on mancozeb exposure and female reproductive disease, we performed a systematic review of literature. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to make this review. An adapted version of the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health and Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework was used to evaluate the risk of bias. Electronic search on two databases (PubMed and Scopus) was used to find experimental studies (in vitro and in vivo) on mancozeb exposure. The database search identified 250 scientific articles, 20 of which met our inclusion criteria. Selected data were then reviewed and summarized in tables. Overall, mancozeb represents a hazard for female reproductive health, with different mechanisms of action. Undoubtedly more experimental and epidemiological studies are required to definitively validate mancozeb as reproductive toxicant.",2020,Menon_2022,1
32344732,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Associations between Green and Blue Spaces and Birth Outcomes.,"Selin Akaraci, Xiaoqi Feng, Thomas Suesse, Bin Jalaludin, Thomas Astell-Burt","Previous studies suggest that green and blue spaces may promote several health outcomes including birth outcomes. However, no synthesis of previous work has specifically asked policy-relevant questions of how much and what type is needed in every neighborhood to elicit these benefits at the population level. A systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to synthesize thirty-seven studies on the association between residential green and blue spaces and pregnancy outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed for birth weight (BW), small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). Increase in residential greenness was statistically significantly associated with higher BW [β = 0.001, 95%CI: (<0.001, 0.002)] and lower odds of SGA [OR = 0.95, 95%CI: (0.92, 0.97)]. Associations between green space and LBW and PTB were as hypothesized but not statistically significant. Associations between blue spaces and pregnancy outcomes were not evident. No study explicitly examined questions of threshold, though some evidence of nonlinearity indicated that moderate amounts of green space may support more favorable pregnancy outcomes. Policy-relevant green and blue space exposures involving theory-driven thresholds warrant testing to ensure future investments in urban greening promote healthier pregnancy outcomes.",2020,Menon_2022,1

32048436,Foetal and childhood exposure to famine and the risks of cardiometabolic conditions in adulthood: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Khemayanto Hidayat, Xuan Du, Bi-Min Shi, Li-Qiang Qin","A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was performed to provide a deeper understanding of the associations between foetal and childhood exposure to famine and the risks of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, obesity, overweight, coronary heart disease, stroke, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in adulthood. Both foetal and childhood exposure to famine were positively associated with the risks of T2DM (foetal exposure: RR 1.37, 95% CI, 1.23-1.52; childhood exposure: RR 1.33, 95% CI, 1.08-1.64), metabolic syndrome (RR 1.26, 95% CI, 1.07-1.50; RR 1.24, 95% CI, 1.13-1.35), hypertension (RR 1.30, 95% CI, 1.07-1.57; RR 1.33, 95% CI, 1.02-1.74), hyperglycaemia (RR 1.27, 95% CI, 1.11-1.45; RR 1.25, 95% CI, 1.10-1.42), dyslipidaemia (RR 1.48, 95% CI, 1.33-1.66; RR 1.27, 95% CI, 1.12-1.45), obesity (RR 1.19, 95% CI, 1.02-1.39; RR 1.13, 95% CI, 1.00-1.28), overweight (RR 1.17, 95% CI, 1.07-1.29; RR 1.07, 95% CI, 1.00-1.14), coronary heart disease (RR 1.22, 95% CI, 1.00-1.51; RR 1.21, 95% CI, 1.09-1.35), and moderate-to-severe NAFLD (RR 1.66, 95% CI, 1.07-2.57; RR 1.68, 95% CI, 1.41-1.99) in adulthood. No association was observed for the risks of stroke or mild NAFLD. Adjustments for age, alcohol, smoking, body mass index, and physical activity nullified some associations. The associations were generally stronger in women than in men. In summary, foetal and childhood exposure to famine may confer greater risks of developing certain cardiometabolic conditions in adulthood, particularly in women. The extent to which risks for cardiometabolic conditions are associated with early-life famine appears to be determined by certain factors in adulthood.",2020,Menon_2022,1

Databases of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched through November 2019, to identify studies that evaluated the relationship between exposure to cadmium, lead, and mercury and risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis in adults. Fourteen eligible studies were included. Effect sizes expressed as pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using weighted random-effect models. Exposure to cadmium (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.56; P ≤ 0.001) and lead (OR = 1.15; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.32; P = 0.05) was associated with an increased risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis, unlike mercury. Subgroup analyses showed cadmium exposure increased the risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis in older (> 65 yrs.; OR = 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08 to 1.88, P = 0.01) compared with younger (18-65 yrs.; OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.52, P = 0.03) adults. Also, lead exposure increased the risk in men (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.15 to 2.09, P = 0.007) unlike in women. By contrast to urinary levels, blood (OR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.47, P = 0.003) and dietary (OR = 1.46; 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.67, P < 0.001) levels of cadmium were associated with an increased risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis.

32240845,Evaluating health risks associated with exposure to ambient surface waters during recreational activities: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Gary S Russo, Sorina E Eftim, Alexandra E Goldstone, Alfred P Dufour, Sharon P Nappier, Timothy J Wade","Recreational water quality guidelines protect the public from health risks associated with water recreation by helping to prevent unacceptable concentrations of pathogenic organisms in ambient water. However, illness risk is associated with both the concentration of pathogens in the water and the degree of contact with those pathogens. Different recreational activities can result in different levels of contact with ambient water containing water-borne pathogens. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to evaluate risks of illness associated with different recreational activities and different levels of contact to ambient surface waters. We screened 8,618 potentially relevant studies for quantitative measures of risk using inclusion/exclusion criteria established in advance. We categorized recreational activities as swimming, sports-related contact, minimal contact, and sand contact. We combined relative risks using a random effects meta-analysis for adverse health outcome categories representing gastrointestinal illness, respiratory illness, skin, eye, ear, nose, throat, and cold/flu illness. We identified 92 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Pooled risk estimates indicate significant elevation of gastrointestinal illness with the recreational activity categories swimming (2.19, 95% CI: 1.82, 2.63) and sports-related contact (2.69, 95% CI: 1.04, 6.92), and nonsignificant elevation of gastrointestinal illness with minimal contact (1.27, 95% CI: 0.74, 2.16). We also found a significant elevation of respiratory illness with swimming (1.78, 95% CI: 1.38, 2.29) and sports-related contact (1.49, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.24), and no elevation of respiratory illness with minimal contact (0.90, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.14). This study suggests that exposures associated with different types of recreational activities are important characteristics of the exposure pathway when assessing illness risk associated with recreation in ambient surface waters.",2020,Menon_2022,1
32386510,"Association between pesticide exposure and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) polymorphisms, and neurobehavioural outcomes in children: a systematic review.","Nkosinathi Banhela, Pragalathan Naidoo, Saloshni Naidoo","Environmental factors such as pollution, pesticide exposure and socio-demographic location have been implicated as a pressure capable of altering genetic make-up. Altered genetic sequence of genes encoding enzymes may result in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Of peculiar interest is the genetic variance on the paraoxonase-1 gene induced by pre- and postnatal exposure to pesticides. SNP have been reported on the paraoxonase-1 gene and post-xenobiotic exposure and are presumed to alter gene sequence and ultimately enzymatic activity. The altered enzymatic activity may facilitate neurodevelopment disorders. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are among the neurodevelopment disorders of which prevalence is concurrently associated with increasing environmental xenobiotic exposure. The variance on xenobiotic metabolising genes is associated with altered neurodevelopment outcome and ultimately altered neurobehavioural outcome. Prime interests of this systematic review were to establish an understanding of the sequences on the paraoxonase-1 gene associated with adverse neurobehavioural outcome. An in-depth literature search was conducted using the term combination ""pesticide exposure, pre- and postnatal exposure, organophosphates/organophosphorus, single nucleotide polymorphism, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), neurodevelopment/neurobehavioural outcome in child/infant"". Articles published from the year 2000 to 2018 were considered for review.

According to recent studies, the associations between PBDEs and rodent male reproductive system are controversial. Therefore, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the effects of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system. Data were extracted from articles collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases. The pooled standard mean deviation (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to evaluate the association between the male rodent reproductive system impairment and PBDE exposure. Ten articles were included in the present meta-analysis and systematic review. The summary SMD of reproductive toxicity associated with PBDEs was -0.46 (95% CI: -0.69, -0.22), and the overall association between DE-71 along with BDE-209 and male reproductive system damage was statistically significant (SMD = -0.7 95% CI: -1.18, -0.21, p = .041; SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.77, -0.05, p = .000).

Subgroup analysis according to the designs and sensitivity analysis based on the Jackknife approach was performed. We observed in the eight studies the association was investigated in different noise exposure groups and in the 10 studies (including two conference papers) the risk of MI was provided per specific unit increment of RTN. We ran two independent types of meta-analyses involving a categorical analysis (comparing the highest and the lowest category of noise exposure groups) and an exposure-response analysis (the risk of MI per 10-dB increment of RTN). The pooled RR (95% CI) of MI for the categorical and exposure-response meta-analyses was calculated 1.03 (0.93, 1.13) and 1.02 (1.00, 1.05), respectively. For both types of meta-analyses, subgroup analysis indicates a significant association in the studies with case-control and cross-sectional designs but not cohort studies. For the exposure-response meta-analysis, a significantly greater risk of MI was observed after excluding the two conference papers (RR = 1.03 and 95% CI = 1.00, 1.05) and by further excluding the studies provided originally the risk of MI only for the categorical analysis (RR = 1.02 and 95% CI = 1.01, 1.03). We did not show a significant publication bias across studies. In conclusion, our study suggests a significant odds of association between exposure to RTN and the risk of MI.",2020,Menon_2022,1
31991162,Systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological literature evaluating the association between exposure to man-made vitreous fibers and respiratory tract cancers.,"Natalie Suder Egnot, Stacey M Benson, Mark F Vater, Rebecca Hazan, Opal Patel, Gary M Marsh","We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies that evaluated occupational exposure to man-made vitreous fibers (MMVF) including glass, rock, and slag wools, and respiratory tract cancers (RTC) including cancers of the larynx, trachea, bronchus, and lung. The MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched in order to identify epidemiological studies that evaluated the association between occupational MMVF exposure and RTCs. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of relevant studies identified by our literature search, and evaluated sources of between-study heterogeneity. The pooled relative risk (RR) of RTC among workers exposed to MMVFs was 1.09 (95% CI = 0.97, 1.22). The RR was closer to 1.0 when limiting the analysis to effect estimates from studies that accounted for the main a priori risk factors for RTC, asbestos exposure and smoking (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.90, 1.18). Overall, our synthesis of the epidemiological literature suggests that occupational MMVF exposure is not associated with risk of RTC.",2020,Menon_2022,1

Because asthma is the most prevalent child respiratory disease internationally, elucidating the role of greenness may substantially benefit public health. The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesize findings related to effects of greenness on asthma in children. Following PRISMA guidelines, six databases were searched for international publication of primary research results relevant to the relationship between greenness and child asthma. Of 82 initial results, seven articles remained after removal of duplicates and applying exclusion criteria. Six reported no direct association between greenness and child asthma, while one found increased greenness protective for asthma. None found a negative direct association between greenness and child asthma. Evidence supported benefits of greenness on child asthma through mediation of factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, high traffic volume, and difficult family relationships. Even without a direct association, greenness can be considered a public health asset as it may mediate other factors contributing to asthma in children. Public health nurses can use these findings to educate clients and partners while advocating for policies to protect greenness.",2020,Menon_2022,1

31809833,Alterations in circadian rhythms following alcohol use: A systematic review.,"Manon Meyrel, Benjamin Rolland, Pierre A Geoffroy","Increasing evidence suggest a bidirectional link between disrupted circadian rhythms and alcohol use disorders (AUD). A better understanding of these alcohol-induced changes in circadian rhythms will likely provide important therapeutic solutions. We conducted a systematic review based on the PubMed database examining biological rhythms in all stages of alcohol use: acute alcohol consumption, AUD, alcohol withdrawal, and abstinence. Different changes in circadian rhythms have been observed after a single acute alcohol intake, but also during AUD and alcohol withdrawal. Following a single acute alcohol intake, changes in biological rhythms are dose-dependent, reflected in the melatonin and cortisol secretions, and the core body temperature (CBT) rhythms. These alterations normalize the next morning and appear mostly for acute alcohol intake higher than 0.5 g/kg. These alterations are more severe during AUD and persist over time. In addition, interestingly, opposite patterns of the melatonin physiological ratio between diurnal and nocturnal secretion (N/D ratio < 1) have been observed during AUD and appear to be a marker of chronic daily use. During alcohol withdrawal, circadian rhythms desynchronization correlates with the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and withdrawal complications such as delirium tremens. During abstinence a resynchronization of circadian rhythms of cortisol and CBT appears in most patients about 1 month after alcohol withdrawal. Disruption of melatonin circadian rhythms can persist after 3-12 weeks of abstinence. The circadian genetic vulnerability associated with biological rhythms alterations in alcohol use disorders increases the risk of relapses. Circadian-based interventions could play a critical role in preventing and treating AUD.",2020,Menon_2022,1
32108942,The banned sunscreen ingredients and their impact on human health: a systematic review.,"Susie Suh, Christine Pham, Janellen Smith, Natasha A Mesinkovska","Recent evidence of high systemic absorption of sunscreen ingredients has raised concerns regarding the safety of sunscreen products. Oxybenzone (BP-3) and octinoxate (OMC), two common sunscreen ingredients, were recently banned in Key West and Hawaii owing to their toxic effects on marine ecosystems. Their impact on human health requires a careful assessment. To summarize the current evidence on the association between the systemic level of BP-3 or OMC and its health impact, a primary literature search was conducted using PubMed database in February 2019. There are 29 studies that address the impact of these ingredients on human health. Studies show that elevated systemic level of BP-3 has no adverse effect on male and female fertility, female reproductive hormone level, adiposity, fetal growth, child's neurodevelopment, and sexual maturation. However, the association of BP-3 level on thyroid hormone, testosterone level, kidney function, and pubertal timing has been reported and prompts further investigations to validate a true association. The systemic absorption of OMC has no reported effect on thyroid and reproductive hormone levels. In conclusion, current evidence is not sufficient to support the causal relationship between the elevated systemic level of BP-3 or OMC and adverse health outcomes. There are either contradictory findings among different studies or an insufficient number of studies to corroborate the observed association. To accurately evaluate the long-term risk of exposure to BP-3 and OMC from sunscreen, a well-designed longitudinal randomized controlled trial needs to be conducted.",2020,Menon_2022,1

The aims of this systematic review are to investigate and summarize the associations between exposures to air pollutants and various sleep measures across the lifespan. PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycInfo were searched through October 2019 to identify original data-based research examining direct epidemiological associations between ambient and indoor air pollution exposures and various sleep health measures, including sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep disturbances, and daytime sleepiness. Twenty-two articles from 2010 to 2019 were selected for inclusion in this review, including a wide range of study populations (from early childhood to elderly) and locations (10 Asian, 4 North American, 3 European, 5 other). Due to variation in both exposure and outcome assessments, conducting a meta-analysis was not plausible. Twenty-one studies reported a generally positive association between exposure and poor sleep quality. While most studies focused on ambient air pollutants, five assessed the specific effect of indoor exposure. In children and adolescents, increased exposure to both ambient and indoor pollutants is associated with increased respiratory sleep problems and a variety of additional adverse sleep outcomes. In adults, air pollution exposure was most notably related to sleep disordered breathing. Existing literature generally shows a negative relationship between exposures to air pollution and sleep health in populations across different age groups, countries, and measures. While many associations between air pollution and sleep outcomes have been investigated, the mixed study methods and use of subjective air pollution and sleep measures result in a wide range of specific associations. Plausible toxicological mechanisms remain inconclusive. Future studies utilizing objective sleep measures and controlling for all air pollution exposures and individual encounters may help ameliorate variability in the results reported by current published literature.",2020,Menon_2022,1

A wealth of occupational epidemiology literature exists around the petrochemical industry, with adverse haematological effects identified in employees exposed to 'low' concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene). Releases from the petrochemical industry are also thought to increase the risk of cancer incidence in fenceline communities.

Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) have become omnipresent in our environment. Individuals may or may not experience clinical health issues from being exposed to the increasing environmental pollution in daily life, but an issue of high concern is that also the non-exposed progeny may encounter consequences of these ancestral exposures. Progress in understanding epigenetic mechanisms opens new perspectives to estimate the risk of man-made EDCs. However, the field of epigenetic toxicology is new and its application in public health or in the understanding of disease etiology is almost non-existent, especially if it concerns future generations. In this review, we investigate the literature on transgenerational inheritance of diseases, published in the past 10 years. We question whether persistent epigenetic changes occur in the male germ line after exposure to synthesized EDCs. Our systematic search led to an inclusion of 43 articles, exploring the effects of commonly used synthetic EDCs, such as plasticizers (phthalates and bisphenol A), pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, atrazine, vinclozin, methoxychlor), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, such as benzo(a)pyrene). Most studies found transgenerational epigenetic effects, often linked to puberty- or adult-onset diseases, such as testicular or prostate abnormalities, metabolic disorders, behavioral anomalies, and tumor development. The affected epigenetic mechanisms included changes in DNA methylation patterns, transcriptome, and expression of DNA methyltransferases. Studies involved experiments in animal models and none were based on human data. In the future, human studies are needed to confirm animal findings. If not transgenerational, at least intergenerational human studies and studies on EDC-induced epigenetic effects on germ cells could help to understand early processes of inheritance. Next, toxicity tests of new chemicals need a more comprehensive approach before they are introduced on the market. We further point to the relevance of epigenetic toxicity tests in regard to public health of the current population but also of future generations. Finally, this review sheds a light on how the interplay of genetics and epigenetics may explain the current knowledge gap on transgenerational inheritance.",2020,Menon_2022,1
32679627,Association between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls and risk of hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Elena Raffetti, Carolina Donat-Vargas, Sara Mentasti, Annalisa Chinotti, Francesco Donato","Experimental and epidemiological studies have suggested an association between exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), ubiquitous environmental toxic compounds, and the risk of hypertension. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies of the association between PCB exposure and the risk of hypertension. Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science and by reviewing reference lists. Study-specific risk estimates comparing the highest versus lowest quantile of PCB distribution were combined using random-effects models. We identified 10 cross-sectional studies, 6 cohort studies, and 1 nested case-control study. A pooled excess risk of hypertension was found for total PCBs (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.28-2.26), dioxin-like (DL)-PCBs (OR 1.46, 1.19-1.79), but not for non-dioxin like (NDL)-PCBs (OR 1.19, 0.81-1.73) comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of the distribution. According to a dose-response meta-analysis, a linear dose-effect relationship was found for total PCBs [OR 2.23 (95% CI: 1.59-3.14) for 1000 ng PCB/g lipid increase]. This positive association remained when stratifying the analyses by study design (cohort vs cross-sectional studies) and population (general population vs high exposed workers/residents). Among single PCB congeners, DL-PCB 105 and 118, and non-DL-PCB138 and 153 were related to hypertension. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that exposure to PCBs, particularly to DL-PCBs, may be a risk factor for hypertension, independently of other risk factors.",2020,Menon_2022,1

Aside from occupational exposures and smoking, diet is the main source of exposure in humans. We performed a systematic review of the association between estimated dietary intake of acrylamide and risk of female breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers in nonexperimental studies published through February 25, 2020, and conducted a dose-response meta-analysis. We identified 18 papers covering 10 different study populations: 16 cohort and two case-control studies. Acrylamide intake was associated with a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer, particularly among never smokers. For endometrial cancer, risk was highest at intermediate levels of exposure, whereas the association was more linear and positive among never smokers. For breast cancer, we found evidence of a null or inverse relation between exposure and risk, particularly among never smokers and postmenopausal women. In a subgroup analysis limited to premenopausal women, breast cancer risk increased linearly with acrylamide intake starting at 20 μg/day of intake. High acrylamide intake was associated with increased risks of ovarian and endometrial cancers in a relatively linear manner, especially among never smokers. Conversely, little association was observed between acrylamide intake and breast cancer risk, with the exception of premenopausal women.",2020,Menon_2022,1

To evaluate the relationship between different kinds of index-based dietary patterns and gastric cancer risk, we systematically searched four English-language databases and four Chinese-language databases. The quality of studies was assessed by the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the association between gastric cancer incidence and different types of index-based dietary patterns. The OR and hazard ratios (HR) of gastric cancer incidence were calculated by regression models in case–control studies and prospective cohort studies, respectively. The studies were pooled in the random effects model to calculate the summarised risk estimate of the highest quantile interval of dietary indices, taking the lowest as the referent. The dietary indices included different versions of Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and dietary inflammatory index (DII), healthy eating index, Chinese Food Pagoda score and food index score. The meta-analysis was carried out for studies on MDS and DII. The combined OR of gastric cancer for the highest MDS v. the referent was 0·42 (95 % CI 0·2, 0·86), and the combined HR was 0·89 (95 % CI 0·68, 1·17).

Comparative global data are scarce and so this review aimed to summarize current evidence on the association between occupational exposure to solar UVR and the development of KCs, with a specific focus on geographical location and skin colour. Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched for potentially relevant records. Extracted data were summarized by study, country and region. We included one prospective cohort study and 18 case-control studies (n = 15 233) from 12 countries in regions where the majority of the population is white skinned (Americas, Europe and Oceania). Eighteen of the 19 studies reported effect estimates suggesting an increased risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and/or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) among outdoor workers. Only 11 studies found a significantly increased risk and many had imprecise estimates. There was a significantly increased risk of BCC and SCC in individual studies in North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Western Europe and Southern Europe, but not across regions or countries. Overall, 95% of studies reported higher risks among outdoor workers, although the increases in risk were statistically significant in just over half of the studies.

The goal of this systematic review was to summarize existing evidence linking FI and general or specific cognitive functions in middle and older adulthood. A systematic search of human studies published between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2018 was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and CAB Direct. Four independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of identified articles and conducted data extraction and data quality assessment. Ten studies were included in the review, including 1 cluster-randomized controlled trial, 2 longitudinal studies, and 7 cross-sectional studies. Three studies reported the association between early-life FI experience and a global cognitive function measure. Nine studies reported later-life FI experience in relation to global or specific cognitive functions. The results suggest an adverse association between FI experienced in early or later life and global cognitive function; and between later-life FI and executive function and memory. Findings from the review are preliminary because of sparse data, heterogeneity across study populations, exposure and outcome assessments, and potential risk of bias across studies. Future studies are recommended to better understand the role of FI in cognitive function, with the goal of identifying possible critical windows for correction of FI in vulnerable subpopulations to prevent neurocognitive deficit in adulthood.",2020,Menon_2022,1

In recent decades, miRNAs have attracted increasing interest to explore the role of epigenetics in response to air pollution. Air pollution, which always contains kinds of particulate matters, are able to reach respiratory tract and blood circulation and then causing epigenetics changes. In addition, extensive studies have illustrated that miRNAs serve as a bridge between particulate matter exposure and health-related effects, like inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, vascular condition and lung function. The purpose of this review is to summarize the present knowledge about the expression of miRNAs in response to particulate matter exposure. Epidemiological and experimental studies were reviewed in two parts according to the size and source of particles. In this review, we also discussed various functions of the altered miRNAs and predicted potential biological mechanism participated in particulate matter-induced health effects.

They focused on DNA methylation in elderly people (blood sample) or infants (placenta sample), with sample size ranging from 306 to 1798. These studies were conducted in relatively low temperature setting (median/mean temperature: 0.8-13 °C), and linear models were used to evaluate temperature-DNA methylation association over short period (≤28 days). It has been reported that short-term ambient temperature could affect global human DNA methylation. A total of 15 candidate genes (ICAM-1, CRAT, F3, TLR-2, iNOS, ZKSCAN4, ZNF227, ZNF595, ZNF597, ZNF668, CACNA1H, AIRE, MYEOV2, NKX1-2 and CCDC15) with methylation status associated with ambient temperature have been identified. DNA methylation on ZKSCAN4, ICAM-1 partly mediated the effect of short-term cold temperature on high blood pressure and ICAM-1 protein (related to cardiovascular events), respectively. In summary, epidemiological evidence about the impacts of environment temperature on human epigenetics remains scarce and limited to short-term linear effect of cold temperature on DNA methylation in elderly people and infants. More studies are needed to broaden our understanding of temperature related epigenetic changes, especially under a changing climate.",2020,Menon_2022,1

Pooled meta-estimates were calculated using random-effects analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted by study area, study design, and Newcastle-Ottawa quality score (NOS). Funnel plots and Egger's test were conducted to evaluate the publication bias, and Fail-safe Numbers (Fail-safe N) were measured to evaluate the robustness of models. From the initial 740 studies (last search, July 11, 2019), 26 studies were included in our analysis. The pooled odds ratio for the change in small for gestational age associated with per 500 m decrease in the distance to roads was 1.016 (95% CI: 1.004, 1.029). Subgroup analyses revealed significant positive associations between term low birth weight and traffic density in higher-quality literatures with higher NOS [1.060 (95% CI: 1.002, 1.121)], cohort studies [1.020 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.033)], and studies in North America [1.018 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.131)].

A growing body of evidence supports the idea that exposure to phthalates can change an individual's physiological set point and the time of puberty in both genders. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, recent studies were evaluated to obtain systematic and regulation results in relation to puberty status and phthalate exposure in girls and boys. We searched English-language papers using Scopus, ISI, and PubMed databases as search engines, with no restriction of time, until the end of July 2019. A comprehensive literature search for an association between phthalate exposure and signs of puberty as well as levels of different types of hormones was carefully performed. Of the 67 studies retained for full-text screening, 39 studies were eligible for data management and extraction. For conducting a meta-analysis, four studies had appropriate effect size and metrics for pooling in the meta-analysis. Our findings revealed that low and high exposure to phthalates could alter pubertal development in both genders; the effects were either early or delayed puberty such as changes in the pubarche, thelarche, and menarche time, as well as in testicular volume. We statistically analyzed the association of pubic-hair development, breast development, and menarche time with exposure to phthalates in girls. For example, the pooled odds ratios of mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and mono (2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) in relation to breast development were (OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.11-1.85) and (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.15-1.58) (P-value < 0.001), respectively. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between pubic-hair development and testicular volume with exposure to phthalates in boys. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of its kind for girls and boys. In conclusion, we found that a positive association exists between phthalate exposure and pubertal timing in the pediatric age group. Therefore, prevention of exposure to phthalates and reduction of their use should be underscored in the strategies for primordial prevention of pubertal timing and related consequences.",2020,Menon_2022,1

We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiologic evidence of the health effects of incinerators, classifying plants in three generations, according to emission limits. A systematic search identified 63 epidemiologic studies, published in English, investigating health effects of incinerators on humans. We focused on cancer, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) and respiratory diseases, pregnancy outcomes and congenital anomalies. Only six studies in the general population were on third generation incinerators providing data on pregnancy outcomes and congenital anomalies. Given the heterogeneity of methods, the abundance of ecological/semi-ecological studies and the lack of reliable quantitative measures of exposure in several studies we did not perform any meta-analysis. No excesses emerged concerning all cancers and lung cancer. An excess of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was reported in some earlier studies, but not for second generation plants. Possible excesses of soft tissue sarcomas were confined to earlier incinerators and the areas closer to the plants. No clear association emerged for CVD and diseases of the respiratory system. Several different pregnancy outcomes were considered, and no consistent association emerged, in spite of a few positive results. Studies were negative for congenital anomalies as a whole. Sporadic excesses were reported in a few studies for specific types of anomalies, but no consistent pattern emerged. Evaluation of the evidence was hindered by heterogeneity in reporting and classification of outcomes across studies. Direct evidence from third generation plants is scarce. Methodological issues in study design (mainly related to exposure assessment, confounding and ecological design) and analysis make interpretation of results complex. In spite of this, the overall evidence suggests that, if there were any excesses at all for older incinerators, they were modest at most. Additional monitoring of third generation plants needs to overcome methodological weaknesses.",2020,Menon_2022,1

A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the relationship between environmental NP exposure and cancer progression risk. Literature surveys were conducted within several international databases using appropriate keywords. A comprehensive search yielded 58 eligible studies involving a wide range of adverse effects, exposure assessment methods, study designs, and experimental models. Most studies reported that NP strongly induced breast cancer progression in intended experiments. Positive associations between NP exposure and ovarian, uterine, pituitary, and testicular cancers were also reported. Although some studies reported no relation between environmental NP exposure and tumour and/or cancer progression, NP (a known endocrine disrupting chemical) induced action mechanisms in multiple experimental models and may interfere with/hyper-activate oestrogen signalling. Secretion of oestrogen and development of reproductive tissues like breasts, uteruses, and ovaries showed strong associations with possible neoplasia (i.e., uncontrolled development of tumours and/or malignant cancers).

Given that epigenetic differences accumulate throughout the lifespan, the assessment of MZ twin pairs discordant for depression offers a genetically informative design to explore DNA methylation while accounting for the typical confounders of the field, shared by co-twins of a pair. In this review, we systematically evaluate all twin studies published to date assessing DNA methylation in association with depressive phenotypes. However, difficulty to recruit large numbers of MZ twin pairs fails to provide enough sample size to develop genome-wide approaches. Alternatively, region and pathway analysis revealed an enrichment for nervous system related functions; likewise, evidence supports an accumulation of methylation variability in affected subjects when compared to their co-twins. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies incorporating known risk factors for depression such as childhood trauma are required for understanding the role that DNA methylation plays in the etiology of depression.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Nontraditional approaches to management, including testis-sparing surgery (TSS) and scrotal orchiectomy, occur in clinical practice. We systematically reviewed studies evaluating outcomes after TSS and scrotal violation for the management of a suspected TGCT. We used PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (January 1980-December 2018) to search for studies addressing morbidity and oncologic outcomes after TSS or scrotal violation for testicular masses concerning for TGCT. Paired reviewers independently screened abstracts for inclusion, sequentially extracted data, and assessed study quality. Twenty-one studies were included (10 TSS, 11 scrotal violation). Risk of local recurrence after TSS on meta-analysis was 7.5% after 3 to 5 years (absolute proportion reported in studies: 10.9%). Aggregated rates of positive margins (1.4%) and testicular atrophy (2.8%) across studies were low with 7.1% of patients requiring subsequent androgen therapy. Scrotal violation led to a higher aggregate risk of local recurrence compared to no scrotal violation (2.5% vs. 0.0%, P < 0.001) but did not appear to impact subsequent metastasis and survival in the short term (3-5 years). Most patients received adjuvant therapy after scrotal violation with 9.3% found to harbor residual primary tumor after scrotal scar excision.

Here, we searched PubMed and performed a meta-analysis of the influence of BP exposure on the risks of cognitive disorders in prospective studies. Dose-response analyses were performed to illustrate the existence of linear/nonlinear relationships. The credibility of each meta-analysis was evaluated according to the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Of the 31 628 citations, 209 were included in our systematic review, among which 136 were eligible for the meta-analysis. Overall, stronger associations were found in midlife than late-life. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that midlife hypertension was related to a 1.19- to 1.55-fold excess risk of cognitive disorders. Dose-response analyses of 5 studies indicated that midlife systolic BP >130 mm Hg was associated with an increased risk of cognitive disorders. With regard to BP exposure in late-life, high systolic BP, low diastolic BP, excessive BP variability, and orthostatic hypotension were all associated with an increased dementia risk. Encouragingly, the use of antihypertensive medications exhibited a 21% reduction in dementia risk. The U-shaped dose-response curve indicated that the protective window of diastolic BP level was between 90 and 100 mm Hg for low risk of Alzheimer disease. The relationships between BP variables and cognitive disorders are age- and BP type-dependent. Antihypertensive medications were associated with a reduced risk of dementia.

Peer-reviewed manuscripts reporting psychological consequences, either in English or Japanese, were selected. A total of 79 studies were selected for the review. Twenty-four studies (30.4%) were conducted as part of the Fukushima Health Management Survey-large-scale cohort study recruiting the residents of the entire Fukushima prefecture. Study outcomes were primarily nonspecific psychological distress, depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. The rates of high-risk individuals determined by the studies varied significantly owing to methodological differences. Nevertheless, these rates were mostly high (nonspecific psychological distress, 8.3%-65.1%; depressive symptoms, 12%-52.0%; and post-traumatic stress symptoms, 10.5%-62.6%). Many studies focused on vulnerable populations such as children, mothers of young children, evacuees, and nuclear power plant workers. However, few studies reported on the intervention methods used or their effect on the survivors. As a conclusion, high rates of individuals with psychological conditions, as well as a wide range of mental conditions, were reported among the Fukushima nuclear disaster survivors in the first 8 years after the disaster. These findings demonstrate the substantial impact of this compound disaster, especially in the context of a nuclear catastrophe.",2021,Menon_2022,0

However, no reference range values are available for 8-isoprosante in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of healthy adults, enabling its meaningful interpretation as a biomarker. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis according to the protocol following PROSPERO (CRD42020146623). After searching and analyzing the literature, we included 86 studies. After their qualitative synthesis and risk of bias assessment, 52 studies were included in meta-analysis. The latter focused on studies using immunological analytical methods and investigated how the concentrations of 8-isoprostane differ based on gender. We found that gender had no significant effect in 8-isoprostane concentration. Among other studied factors, such as individual characteristics and factors related to EBC collection, only the device used for EBC collection significantly affected measured 8-isoprostane concentrations. However, adjustment for the factors related to EBC collection, yielded uncertainty whether this effect is due to the device itself or to the other factors. Given this uncertainty, we estimated the reference range values of 8-isoprostane stratified by gender and EBC collection device.

LNR has recently emerged as a prognostic factor in rectal cancer. The objective of our study was to pool eligible studies to elucidate the prognostic role of LNR on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in rectal cancer patients using a meta-analysis. Methods A systematic database search was performed in MEDLINE and Embase for relevant studies that reported LNR in rectal cancer. Two authors independently screened the relevant articles for selection and data extraction. As a result, a list of such studies and references, published in English up to December 2019, was obtained, and a total of 4,486 node-positive patients in 18 studies were included in this meta-analysis.

This systematic review and meta-analysis estimate the pooled prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems among police personnel worldwide. Three independent reviewers searched 16 databases and screened 11 506 articles published between January 1980 and October 2019. Eligible studies involved at least 100 active police professionals and used validated instruments to ascertain specific mental health problems. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 60 cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies, involving 272 463 police personnel from 24 countries met criteria for inclusion. The overall pooled point prevalence was 14.6% for depression (95% CI 10.9% to 18.6%), 14.2% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; 95% CI 10.3% to 18.7%), 9.6% for a generalised anxiety disorder (95% CI 6.7% to 12.9%), 8.5% for suicidal ideation (95% CI 6.1% to 11.2%), 5.0% for alcohol dependence (95% CI 3.5% to 6.7%) and 25.7% for hazardous drinking (95% CI 19.6% to 32.4%). The strongest risk factor for depression and suicidal ideation was higher occupational stress, and the strongest risk factors for PTSD were higher occupational stress and avoidant coping strategies. Higher levels of peer-support were associated with significantly lower PTSD symptoms. Our findings suggest that the prevalence of mental health problems among police exceeds twice that previously reported in mixed samples of first responders, and is associated with poor social support, occupational stress and maladaptive coping strategies.

This review employed the developmental psychopathology framework and 4P model (Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective) to organize the diverse risk/protective factors (distal variables experienced indirectly by the child) and processes (proximal variables experienced directly by the child) for child sleep problems among preschool (1-5 y) and school-age (6-10 y) children. Variables were categorized into biological, psychological, and environmental factors/processes at the individual, family/parent, and community levels. The quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. A literature search identified 98 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Older child age, difficult temperament, previous sleep problems, externalizing psychopathology, internalizing psychopathology, and electronics use (e.g., bedtime TV viewing) were identified as child risk variables predicting sleep problems. Parental presence at bedtime (risk), negative parenting style (e.g., lax or permissive parenting; risk), consistent bedtime routines (protective), and lower composite socioeconomic status (risk) were identified as family/parent variables predicting child sleep problems. No well-established predictors were found at the community level.

Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) has been shown to be associated with development of HO. However, risk factors for HO following SCI are unknown. In light of this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize available evidence and elucidate risk factors associated with heterotopic ossification. An electronic literature search was conducted using five databases. Studies containing SCI patients, with a proportion diagnosed with HO, were included. Meta-analyses were performed to assess the association between following risk factors and development of HO: sex, type of injury, spasticity, pressure ulcer, injury level, urinary tract infection (UTI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), number of smokers, and pneumonia. Nine studies with 2,115 patients were included. It was found that males (Odds Ratio [95% Confidence Interval]: 2.25 [1.61, 3.13]), smokers (2.88 [1.62, 5.11]), patients with complete injury (3.61 [2.29, 5.71]), pneumonia (2.86 [2.18, 3.75]), pressure ulcers (2.45 [1.89, 3.18]), UTI (3.84 [2.63, 5.62]) and spasticity (2.12 [1.67, 2.68]) had significantly higher odds of developing HO after spinal cord injury. In contrast, location of injury (Cervical vs. thoracic injury; (1.03 [0.72, 1.49]) and DVT (1.37 [0.91, 2.07]) were not associated with development of HO.

We investigated the effects of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) on the inflammatory profile in allergic mouse models, which are currently under development in signal transduction materials. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant literature using the search terms "" PI3K inhibitor"" and ""allergy"" or ""asthma"". Cochrane Review Manager and R were used for handling continuous variables. The primary outcomes of the inflammatory profile were divided into cell counts and inflammatory cytokines. We used a random effects model to draw a forest plot. Through the database search and subsequent selection, 17 articles were identified. Regarding the cell counts, both the PI3K pan-inhibitors and PI3K-δ inhibitors effectively reduced the total cell counts, eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes. In contrast to PI3K-δ inhibitors, PI3K pan-inhibitors effectively reduced macrophages. Regarding the inflammatory cytokines, PI3K pan-inhibitors and PI3K-δ inhibitors effectively reduced total IgE, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α, IL-1β, VEGF and had no effect on IL-6. Compared to the PI3K pan-inhibitors, which block all pathways, selective PI3K-δ inhibitors are expected to be relatively less toxic.

32375500,Non-specific effects of acupuncture and sham acupuncture in clinical trials from the patient's perspective: a systematic review of qualitative evidence.,"Robin St Ho, Charlene Hl Wong, Justin Cy Wu, Samuel Ys Wong, Vincent Ch Chung","Previous clinical trials have demonstrated that both acupuncture and sham acupuncture exert significant, non-specific effects on treatment outcomes when compared to no-treatment controls. A recently developed framework (mechanisms in orthodox and complementary and alternative medicine-MOCAM) suggests that the non-specific effects of acupuncture originate from multiple domains (e.g. patient characteristics, acupuncturist skill/technique, the patient-acupuncturist relationship, and the acupuncture environment). However, it remains to be determined precisely how these domains influence the non-specific effects of treatment among patients receiving acupuncture and sham acupuncture in clinical trials. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to synthesize existing qualitative evidence on how trial participants randomized to acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups experience non-specific effects, regardless of the types of medical condition investigated.",2021,Menon_2022,0

Nevertheless, the prognostic value of AR expression in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains controversial. Therefore, in this meta-analysis, we investigated AR expression and its impact on survival outcome. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and references of articles were searched to identify relevant studies that investigated the association between AR expression and prognosis in patients diagnosed with TNBC and were published between 1946 and May 2019. The hazard ratio (HR) and confidence interval (CI) of disease-free survival, overall survival, distant disease-free survival, and recurrence-free survival were weighted and pooled by using the fixed-effect or random-effect model based on the heterogeneity of included studies. A total of 27 studies including 4914 patients with TNBC were included. AR was expressed in 27.96% (1315/4703) of patients with TNBC. In addition, AR expression in TNBC was not associated with disease-free survival (HR, 0.923; 95% CI, 0.671-1.271; P = .634), overall survival (HR, 0.910; 95% CI, 0.678-1.222; P = .531), distant disease-free survival (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.96-1.08; P = .489), or recurrence-free survival (HR, 0.957; 95% CI, 0.462-1.982; P = .906) in TNBC, regardless of confounding factors and heterogeneity that existed among included studies.

The objective of this study was to synthesize current evidence defining the role of postoperative RT in patients with DTC. A systematic review and meta-analysis were done. Included studies compared oncologic outcomes and toxicity of RT vs no RT in patients with DTC. Nine studies were included, two prospective and seven retrospective cohorts. RT improved 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival but not overall survival and distant metastasis failure-free survival. The locoregional control benefit was seen in patients at increased risk for recurrence, including those with advanced age, locoregionally advanced disease, gross or microscopic residual tumor, and structural invasion. Serious RT-related acute and late toxicities were rare. Available evidence suggests that postoperative RT can improve locoregional control in high-risk DTC with acceptable toxicity.

Determinants of nutrition transition in sub-Saharan Africa are presently not well understood. The objective of this review was to synthesise available data on determinants of dietary and physical activity behaviours among women of reproductive age in urban sub-Saharan Africa according to the socio-ecological framework. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and bibliographies of included articles for qualitative, observational and randomised controlled studies published in English from January 2000 to September 2018. Studies conducted within general populations of women aged 18-49 years were included. Searches were according to a predefined protocol published on PROSPERO (ID = CRD42018108532). Two reviewers independently screened identified studies. From a total of 9853 unique references, twenty-three studies were retained and were mainly from South and West Africa. No rigorous designed quantitative study was identified. Hence, data synthesis was narrative. Notable determinants of dietary behaviour included: convenience, finances, social network, food skills and knowledge gaps, food deserts and culture. Cultural beliefs include strong relationship between high social status and weight gain, energy-dense confectionery, salt or fat-rich foods. Physical activity is influenced by the fast-changing transport environment and cultural beliefs which instigate unfavourable gender stereotypes. Studies with rigorous qualitative and quantitative designs are required to validate and develop the proposed frameworks further, especially within East Africa.

The aims of this study were to investigate the association of p63 + MCC with clinicopathological features and to estimate survival through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Virtual Health Library following the PRISMA guidelines was conducted on September 2017. DerSimonian and Lard random-effects models were used to calculate survival-weighted means and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) among studies. Five studies met our inclusion criteria after screening 77 citations and 36 full-text articles. The included studies enrolled 413 patients with MCC.

Emerging evidence demonstrates that children born of pregnancies complicated by GDM may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adulthood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine cardiovascular risk factors in offspring exposed to GDM in utero. PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases were searched. Information was extracted on established CVD risk factors including blood pressure, lipids, blood glucose, fasting insulin, body mass index (BMI), and endothelial/microvascular function. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018094983). Prospective and retrospective studies comparing offspring exposed to GDM compared to controls (non-GDM pregnancies) were considered. We included studies that defined GDM based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) definition, or prior definitions. The PRISMA guidelines were followed in conducting this systematic review. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two independent reviewers. The data were pooled using a random-effects model.

However, this knowledge is limited. The present study aims to summarize previous studies by performing a systematic review and meta-analyses. The terms ""multiple sclerosis"" combined with DMDs of interest and a broad profile for pregnancy terms were used to search Embase and Medline databases to identify relevant studies published from January 2000 to July 2019.1260 studies were identified and ten studies met our inclusion criteria. Pooled risk ratios (RR) of pregnancy and birth outcomes in pregnancies exposed to DMDs compared to those not exposed were calculated using a random effects model. For spontaneous abortion RR = 1.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.32, for preterm births RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.21 and for major congenital malformations RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.47-1.56. The most common major congenital malformations reported in MS patients exposed to MS drugs were atrial septal defect (ASD) (N = 4), polydactyly (N = 4) and club foot (N = 3), which are among the most prevalent birth defects observed in the general population. In conclusion, interferons, glatiramer acetate or natalizumab, do not appear to increase the risk for spontaneous abortions, pre-term birth or major congenital malformations. There were very few patients included that were exposed to fingolimod, azathioprine and rituximab; therefore, these results cannot be generalized across drugs. Future studies including internal comparators are needed to enable treating physicians and their patients to decide on the best treatment options.",2020,Menon_2022,0

To date, little is known about the effectiveness of universal multiple-risk lifestyle interventions to reduce depressive symptoms. We conducted a SR/MA to assess the effectiveness of universal multiple-risk lifestyle interventions (by promoting a healthy diet, physical activity and/or smoking cessation) to reduce depressive symptoms in adults. We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, WOS, OpenGrey, the ICTRP and other sources from inception to 16 September 2019. We selected only randomized controlled trials, with no restrictions on language or setting. Our outcome was the reduction of depressive symptoms.

One commonly recognized response to trauma exposure is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The biological underpinnings of PTSD, including epigenetic mechanisms of DNA methylation and gene expression, have been studied intensively. However, psychological posttrauma responses vary widely and can include positive outcomes, such as posttraumatic growth (PTG) and, more commonly, resilience. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the current DNA methylation and gene expression data with respect to three potential posttrauma responses: PTSD, PTG, and resilience. A literature search identified 486 studies, 51 of which were deemed eligible for inclusion (total N = 10,633). All included studies examined PTSD and consistently implicated DNA methylation and gene expression changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and inflammatory genes. Ten studies acknowledged resilience as a posttrauma response, but only two studies examined epigenetics and gene expression using a scale to measure resilience. Low resilience was associated with gene expression patterns in immune and dopamine genes, and high resilience was associated with a blunted inflammatory response. No studies examined epigenetic or gene expression changes associated with PTG. These findings highlight a focus on pathogenic research, which has failed to adequately acknowledge and measure positive posttrauma outcomes of PTG and resilience. Future research should examine DNA methylation and gene expression changes associated with PTG and resilience in addition to PTSD in order to gain a more comprehensive picture of an individual's well-being following exposure to trauma.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Although radiation dermatitis is reported by either the clinician or the patient, previous studies have shown disagreement between clinician-reported outcomes (CROs) and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). This review evaluated the extent of discordance between CROs and PROs for radiation dermatitis. Studies reporting both clinician and patient-reported outcomes for external beam RT were eligible. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, while 8 of these studies were eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis of acute and late skin toxicities. We found an overall agreement between CROs and PROs of acute skin colour change, fibrosis and/or retraction, and moist desquamation (p > 0.005). Reporting of late breast pain, breast edema, skin colour change, telangiectasia, fibrosis and/or retraction and induration/fibrosis alone (p > 0.005) were also in agreement between clinicians and patients. Our meta-analysis revealed a greater reporting of acute breast pain by patients (RR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.87-0.92, p < 0.001), greater reporting of acute breast edema by physicians (RR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.65-1.97, p < 0.001) and a greater reporting of late breast shrinkage by patients (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.86, p = 0.005). However, our review was limited by the discrepancies between PRO and CRO measurement tools as well as the absence of standard time points for evaluation of radiation dermatitis. Given potential discrepancies between CROs and PROs, both measures should be reported in future studies.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Álvaro López-Janeiro, Carlos Padilla-Ansala, Carlos E de Andrea, David Hardisson, Ignacio Melero","Macrophage polarization is relevant for tumor biology. M2 polarized macrophages favor tumor growth and survival, while M1 macrophages support tumor destruction and antigen presentation. Markers identifying M1/M2 polarization are a subject of debate. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association of proposed macrophage markers with prognosis across epithelial tumors and melanoma. The Medline search engine was used and 195 articles were recovered for full review. Only articles which measured markers using immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence and had overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint were included. One hundred and thirteen articles were finally accepted for analysis. CD68 was associated with worse survival across tumors (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.11-1.37). Tumor anatomical location influenced this association. Colorectal tumors showed an inverse association between CD68 and OS in contrast to the rest of cancer types (HR = 0.56 vs. 1.34). The approach taken to measure CD68 had an impact on prognosis; when macrophages were measured at the tumor invasion front prognosis was more favorable than when they were measured intratumorally (HR = 0.94 vs. 1.4). CD163, CD204, and CD206 showed a robust association with worse OS (HR = 1.63, 1.95, 1.65, respectively). Tumors arising in the lung and the liver showed a weaker association between CD163 and OS as compared with other locations (β = -0.5401 for the lung and -0.5940 for the liver compared with other anatomical locations). The counting strategy also had an impact on CD163 association with OS, with hot-spot counting having higher HRs compared with averaging macrophage counts across spots or absolute cell counting (β = -0.4678). In conclusion, proposed M2 markers are associated with worse survival across epithelial tumors and melanoma. The anatomical origin of tumors influences this association. The compartment where the macrophages were scored and counting strategy influenced the association with OS of CD68 and CD163, respectively.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Because no summative assessment of these prospective trials exists to date, we systematically reviewed the outcomes and toxicities associated with therapy de-intensification for this population. PRISMA-guided systematic PubMed searches (along with articles known to the authors and references thereof) were performed for prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes and/or toxicities of de-intensified RT and/or systemic therapy (with or without surgery), exclusively for HPV-associated OPC. Ten prospective studies were analyzed. Performing a meta-analysis was not entirely possible owing to the heterogeneity of treatment paradigms and the lack of >2 studies for most paradigms; however, because just one paradigm (induction chemotherapy followed by reduced-dose RT and/or systemic therapy) had 4 associated articles, an exploratory meta-analysis was conducted for that subset. Two trials of dose-reduced concurrent chemoradiotherapy (60 Gy/weekly cisplatin) demonstrated 3-year distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival (OS) ranging from 91 to 100% and 95%, respectively; acute grade 3+ mucositis and dysphagia occurred in 33-35% and 21-39%, respectively. In the four trials of induction chemotherapy (platinum/taxane-based) followed by dose-reduced RT, 2-year progression-free and OS ranged from 80 to 95% and 83 to 98%, respectively; acute grade 3+ dysphagia, dermatitis, and mucositis ranged from 9 to 15%, 7 to 20%, and 9 to 30% (excluding one outlier), respectively.

Using PRISMA guidelines, appropriate databases were searched. 190 papers were returned with 38 articles fully reviewed. Articles were each independently quality rated by two authors using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool and data were extracted. Of the 38 articles, 23 were rated as very high quality. Most study participants were adults (n = 7769) with n = 727 child participants. Only seven of the very/high-quality studies were prospective and involved children. Methylation was the most studied method of epigenetic modification. There is some evidence supporting epigenetic modification of certain markers in participants exposed to ACEs measured in adulthood. Research is lacking on non-coding aspects of the epigenome and on coding aspects other than DNA methylation. There is some evidence of a more powerful effect on telomere length if physical neglect was involved.

The main risk for bioprostheses is structural valve degeneration (SVD); however, little is known about what the most important risk factors are. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the risk factors and estimate their pooled effect sizes to aid the prosthesis choice for replacement. We followed PRISMA guidelines and systematically searched three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) using appropriate key terms: 'aortic valve', 'bioprosthesis', 'degeneration', 'durability', 'prosthesis failure', etc. Hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted. Pooled risk estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Twenty-nine (29) observational studies were included with a total of 25,490 patients, 981 of whom developed SVD over a mean follow-up time of 18.5 years. Four (4) factors influencing bioprosthetic SVD were identified: increasing age was a protective factor (per 1-yr increase, HR: 0.91 [95% CI 0.89, 0.94], p<0.0001), whereas increased body surface area (HR 1.77 [1.04, 3.01], p=0.034), patient-prosthesis mismatch (HR 1.95 [1.56, 2.43], p<0.001), and smoking (HR 2.28 [1.37, 3.79], p=0.0015) were risk factors for SVD. We found younger age, patient-prosthesis mismatch, body surface area, and smoking, as risk factors for aortic SVD, which should be considered for valve selection. This study generates a further hypothesis that accelerated flow across the valve is a shared key component in the pathophysiology of SVD, thus future research should consider other high cardiac output states.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The search for a medication that could reduce risk of serious disease, and ideally of any manifestation of disease from SARS-CoV2, and of asymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV2 is of urgent interest. Repurposing existing pharmaceuticals is among the approaches to achieve these ends. We performed a systematic review of all interventional studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a focus on one repurposed drug, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The detailed analysis of these studies, some of them already recruiting, provide an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 prophylaxis around the world.

Relevant literature on adults undergoing transplant with known MRD status pre-transplant was extracted from the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases (through 8 May 2018) and oncology conferences (2014-2018) using keywords for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MRD. Thirty primary studies reporting SCT outcomes were identified. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival indicated that patients with MRD pre-transplant were more likely to die post-SCT vs. patients with no detectable MRD (HR: 1.51-3.856). In post-SCT relapse studies, 16-100% of patients with MRD vs. 0-50% of patients without MRD relapsed. This review found evidence of markedly worse outcomes post-transplant among patients with vs. without MRD pre-transplant, including shorter median survival (overall, relapse-free, and event-free survival), higher risk of death, more relapse events, and decreased likelihood of remaining in hematologic remission.",2020,Menon_2022,0

This systematic review and meta-analysis identified predictors of participant nonadherence to returning for annual LDCT screening. The systematic review protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD42019118347). MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AgeLine, grey literature sources, and reference lists of included studies were searched until March 1st, 2020. Primary research articles were eligible for inclusion if they screened current or former smokers using LDCT as their primary screening modality and reported on participant demographics or programmatic interventions that predicted nonadherence. Risk of bias assessment was performed at both study and outcome levels. The primary outcome was predictors of nonadherence. The secondary outcomes were relative risks (RR) of second round nonadherence based on identified predictors, which were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses. Across 13 included studies (total n = 15,790; range: 157-3642), the overall rate of nonadherence was 28% (95% CI: 20-37%). Studies identified greater nonadherence in participants younger than 60 or older than 74, with longer travel distances to screening centers, and having a low risk perception of lung cancer. Meta-analyses identified higher nonadherence in community-based compared to academic-based programs, but this did not reach significance (32% versus 27%; p = 0.32). Current smokers were more likely to be nonadherent compared to former smokers (RR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.09-1.40; p < 0.01) while white participants were less likely nonadherent compared to non-white participants (RR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.60-0.81; p < 0.0001). No differences existed between male and female participants (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.85-1.15; p = 0.85). Programmatic interventions, including dedicated program coordinators, reminder calls/letters, and mobile LDCT scanners reduced nonadherence in lung cancer screening programs.

Oxytocin is a peptide involved in the modulation of social cognition, emotional skills and the reward system, all deficient in PTSD, and thus it has been suggested as a promising pharmacological target. In this systematic review, the potential effects of intranasal OT (INOT) administration on core symptoms in PTSD patients are discussed, as well as neurobiological correlates in functional imaging supporting its clinical evidence. The fourteen studies included in the present review provide tentative evidence that INOT could be a safe pharmacological intervention, although the results were mixed and insufficient to quantify the effectiveness of this intervention. Specifically, the primary outcome measures differed consistently between studies, and the sample sizes were usually small. Considering the neurobiological and clinical evidences, tentative hypotheses can be made on the possible role of INOT in facilitating socially- and goal-oriented cognition and behaviour, thus promoting a better therapeutic alliance and treatment outcome. Such strategies need to be further supported by literature. For instance, only one study to date has directly investigated the use of INOT as an augmentation strategy for psychotherapy (namely, Prolonged Exposure therapy) and for a limited time, nevertheless providing promising results for the efficacy and the medium-term tolerability of this drug after multiple administrations.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Its use in alopecia has been much less studied in the literature. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of the literature in December 2019 in order to index published cases of alopecia patients treated with botulinum toxin. Pub Med, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were explored. Six studies that included 94 patients were selected. Only one study was prospectively controlled against placebo. Of the 94 patients, 85 were affected by androgenetic alopecia, 8 by alopecia areata, and 1 by radiation-induced alopecia. The doses injected per session varied between 30 and 150 units and the number of sessions between 1 and 12. In the majority of the studies, the injections were carried out in all the muscles of the scalp (frontal, temporal, peri-auricular, occipital). Four studies showed a frank improvement in hair growth. Two of them showed improvement in hair density using an objective endpoint (hair count). The remaining reported studies showed inconclusive results.

Ten studies were included. A 16-item checklist was used to assess their methodological quality. Four studies analyzed healthy skin and six included pathological conditions. All determined skin's thermal behavior, and studies including pathological conditions also analyzed burn damage. Studies did not present a wide variety of mathematical formulation, emphasizing on modelling equations of well-established models from the literature, such as the Pennes' bioheat transfer equation, and the Henriques and Moritz model to quantify skin damage. Reporting of modelling characteristics and formulation of the computational models is not standardized and there is shortage of implementation of validation procedures, hindering representative conclusions.

This systematic review aimed to investigate risk factors, trends, and variability associated with the development of BIPN. Searches were undertaken using Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Additional studies were identified by investigating authors' bibliographic references cited by original and review articles. Articles that reported on neuropathy in phase III randomised control trials involving bortezomib in any treatment arm for the treatment of MM were included in this review. A total of 43 full text articles met criteria, which examined 23 phase III trials (N = 8218). Overall incidence of neuropathy ranged from 8.4% to 80.5% (median = 37.8%) and severe neuropathy (grade 3-4) ranged from 1% to 33.2% (median = 8%). Similar reports of neuropathy of any grade and severe neuropathy were observed between the newly diagnosed and relapsed cohort. Bortezomib regimens with reduced dose intensity were associated with reduced neuropathy incidence. Increased cumulative dosing levels, intravenous compared with subcutaneous administration and combination therapy with thalidomide were associated with higher rates of BIPN. This analysis revealed that BIPN is a significant toxicity. More sensitive measures are required to capture the incidence and severity of BIPN.

This umbrella review examined (1) what relationship, if any, is evident between specific spinal postures or physical activities and LBP; (2) the quality of existing systematic reviews in this area; and (3) the extent to which previous systematic reviews demonstrate causality. Five electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles were searched from January 1990 to June 2018. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses on spine posture or physical exposure and LBP symptoms (self-report) or outcomes (e.g. work absence, medical consultation) were included. The AMSTAR and the Bradford Hill Criteria were utilised to critically appraise the quality of included systematic reviews and to determine the extent to which these reviews demonstrated causality. Two independent reviewers screened 4285 publications with 41 reviews included in the final review. Both positive and null associations between spine posture, prolonged standing, sitting, bending and twisting, awkward postures, whole body vibration, and components of heavy physical work were reported. Results from meta-analyses were more consistently in favour of an association, whereas systematic reviews that included only prospective studies were less able to provide consistent conclusions. Evidence that these factors precede first time LBP or have a dose response relationship with LBP outcomes was mixed. Despite the availability of many reviews, there is no consensus regarding causality of physical exposure to LBP.

Successful generalisation is necessary for an intervention to have benefits in everyday life beyond the original learning environment. We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of early social communication interventions for children with autism in order to explore generalisation and its measurement. We identified nine RCTs that provided evidence of initial target learning and measured generalisation, of which eight demonstrated at least some successful generalisation across people, settings, and/or activities. The findings did not support the widely reported generalisation 'difficulties' associated with autism. However, generalisation was not consistent across all skills within studies, and one study found no generalisation despite evidence for initial target learning within the intervention context. In general, there are few methodologically sound social communication intervention studies exploring generalisation in autism and no consensus on how it should be measured. In particular, failure to demonstrate initial learning of target skills within the intervention setting and an absence of formal mediation analyses of the hypothesised mechanisms limit current research. We outline a framework within which measurement of generalisation can be considered for use in future trials. To maximise the effectiveness of interventions, the field needs to gain a better understanding of the nature of generalisation among autistic individuals and what additional strategies may further enhance learning. Autism Res 2020, 13: 506-522. © 2020 The Authors. Autism Research published by International Society for Autism Research published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: It is generally considered that autistic individuals experience difficulties applying things they have learned in one context into different settings (e.g. from school to home). This is important to consider for intervention studies. Our review does not support a complete lack of generalisation but instead suggests that after early social communication intervention, autistic children can transfer some skills to new contexts. Overall, there is limited research in this area and further work is needed.",2020,Menon_2022,0

To review existing literature on causative agents of DILI in the East compared to the West, a comprehensive literature search was performed on electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure without language restrictions. Studies which involve patients having DILI and reported the frequency of causative agents were included. A random effects model was applied to synthesize the current evidence using prevalence of class-specific and agent-specific causative drugs with 95% confidence intervals. Of 6,914 articles found, 12 showed the distribution of drugs implicated in DILI in the East with a total of 33,294 patients and 16 in the West with a total of 26,069 DILI cases. In the East, the most common agents by class were anti-tuberculosis drugs (26.6%), herbal and alternative medications (25.3%), and antibiotics (15.7%), while in the West, antibiotics (34.9%), cardiovascular agents (17.3%), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (12.5%) were the commonest. For individual agents, the most common agents in the East were isoniazid-rifampicin-pyrazinamide (25.4%), phenytoin (3.5%), and cephalosporin (2.9%) while in the West, amoxicillin-potassium clavulanate combination acid (11.3%), nimesulide (6.3%), and ibuprofen (6.1%) were the commonest.

There is evidence to suggest that the ISUP grade group 4 is a heterogeneous entity regarding prognosis. Our aim was to systematically examine the existing evidence to determine if outcome differences exist within the ISUP grade group 4. A systematic search of the literature for all studies examining the heterogeneity of the ISUP grade group 4 was conducted. Available studies were combined with meta-analysis to evaluate prognostic differences within the ISUP grade group 4 measured by all-cause mortality (ACM) and the prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Eight studies were identified and utilised a variety of outcome measures to answer the question of heterogeneity within the ISUP grade group 4. Four of these studies examined prognosis using both ACM and PCSM. These were combined into a meta-analysis. The combined group of 5 + 3/3 + 5 had statistically significant higher ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% confidence internal [Cl] 1.08-1.41) when compared to the 4 + 4 group. There was no difference in the PCSM between the two groups (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89-2.01). However, heterogeneity was high for this analysis secondary to a range of methodological differences. Our meta-analysis showed that Gleason grade 3 + 5/5 + 3 had higher ACM than Gleason grade group 4 + 4. Measures of PCSM were statistically insignificant, although heterogeneity was high. Evidence suggests that heterogeneity is likely, although inconclusive. Further studies with consistent methodologies are required to answer this question.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32433598,Effects of probiotics and paraprobiotics on subjective and objective sleep metrics: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Christopher Irwin, Danielle McCartney, Ben Desbrow, Saman Khalesi","Inadequate sleep (i.e., duration and/or quality) is becoming increasingly recognized as a global public health issue. Interaction via the gut-brain axis suggests that modification of the gut microbial environment via supplementation with live microorganisms (probiotics) or nonviable microorganisms/microbial cell fractions (paraprobiotics) may improve sleep health. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the effect of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics on subjective and objective sleep metrics. Online databases were searched from 1980 to October 2019 for studies involving adults who consumed probiotics or paraprobiotics in controlled trials, during which, changes in subjective and/or objective sleep parameters were examined. A total of 14 studies (20 trials) were included in meta-analysis. Random effects meta-analyses indicated that probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation significantly reduced Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score (i.e., improved sleep quality) relative to baseline (-0.78-points, 95% confidence interval: 0.395-1.166; p < 0.001). No significant effect was found for changes on other subjective sleep scales, nor objective parameters of sleep (efficiency/latency) measured using polysomnography or actigraphy. Subgroup analysis for PSQI data suggested that the magnitude of the effect was greater (although not statistically) in healthy participants than those with a medical condition, when treatment contained a single (rather than multiple) strain of probiotic bacteria, and when the duration of treatment was ≥8 weeks. Probiotics/paraprobiotics supplementation may have some efficacy in improving perceived sleep health, measured using the PSQI. While current evidence does not support a benefit of consuming probiotics/paraprobiotics when measured by other subjective sleep scales, nor objective measures of sleep; more studies using well-controlled, within-subject experimental designs are needed.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Using keywords such as ""smoking"", ""grilling"", ""processing"", ""roasting"", ""barbecue"", ""curing"", ""reduction"", ""decrease"", ""polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon"", ""benzo(a)pyrene"", ""removal"", 1191 references were collected from databases. After sorting, only 37 appeared to be relevant to the topic of the review. These 37 papers were coded with one or two keywords representing methods of PAHs reduction using R-based Qualitative Data Analysis library. The results showed that PAHs reduction strategies can be applied either before (or during) grilling or smoking (barrier methods) or after grilling or smoking (removal methods). Before grilling or smoking, use of marinade, preheating of products, appropriate fuel (poor in lignin), filter, collection system of juice and fat (to avoid them dripping into embers) are the main strategies which can be applied. After grilling or smoking, the methods consist of washing the surface of smoked or grilled products with hot water (60 °C) or storing smoked products packed into low density or high density polyethylene. A flowchart regrouping methods which can be used individually or in combination for PAHs reduction in smoked meat and fishery products is suggested.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.",2020,Menon_2022,0

However, HIV is not routinely recognized as a sarcopenia risk factor outside of HIV literature. The purposes of this study were to establish the prevalence and predictors of sarcopenia among PLHIV, and to compare the prevalence of sarcopenia among PLHIV and people without HIV. A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, and Scielo databases was performed following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Identified articles were included if they evaluated sarcopenia among PLHIV using either the presence of low muscle mass only or low muscle mass in association with low muscle function. The pooled prevalence of sarcopenia among PLHIV and the odds ratio for sarcopenia in PLHIV compared with controls were calculated. From 13 studies and 2267 participants, the prevalence of sarcopenia among PLHIV was 24.1% (95% CI = 17.8-31.0%). PLHIV presented 6.1 greater odds (95% CI = 1.1-33.5) of sarcopenia compared with people without HIV, matched by age, sex, BMI, and ethnicity. Longer exposure to specific HIV drugs, tobacco and alcohol, lower education and employment rates, and greater HIV duration were associated with sarcopenia. In conclusion, PLHIV had a high prevalence of sarcopenia, related to both HIV and non-HIV risk factors. HIV should be considered a risk factor for sarcopenia in the general population.

However, no systematic review and meta-analysis have addressed the issue of the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in coronavirus disease 2019. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the objectives of evaluation of safety and efficacy of HCQ alone or in combination in terms of ""time to clinical cure,"" ""virological cure,"" ""death or clinical worsening of disease,"" ""radiological progression,"" and safety. RevMan was used for meta-analysis. We searched 16 literature databases out of which seven studies (n = 1358) were included in the systematic review. In terms of clinical cure, two studies reported possible benefit in ""time to body temperature normalization"" and one study reported less ""cough days"" in the HCQ arm. Treatment with HCQ resulted in less number of cases showing the radiological progression of lung disease (odds ratio [OR], 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.9). No difference was observed in virological cure (OR, 2.37, 95% CI, 0.13-44.53), death or clinical worsening of disease (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1.37-21.97), and safety (OR, 2.19, 95% CI, 0.59-8.18), when compared with the control/conventional treatment. Five studies reported either the safety or efficacy of HCQ + azithromycin. Although seems safe and effective, more data are required for a definitive conclusion.

Only 2 published randomized clinical trials were found, with a pooled sample size of 183 (RIC, 92; MAC, 91). Both studies suggested an overall survival advantage after RIC, with a pooled hazard ratio (HR) of .67 (95% confidence interval [CI], .41 to 1.09) for RIC versus MAC. Relapse results were also concordant, with a pooled HR of 1.55 (95% CI, .74 to 3.25) for RIC versus MAC. Neither result was statistically significant.

Morphine remains the most effective and recommended treatment for cancer pain. However, cancer patients still do not receive appropriate management for their pain, and under-treatment is common. Lack of knowledge and negative attitudes towards cancer pain and analgesia among professionals, patients and family caregivers are reported as one of the most common barriers to effective cancer pain management (CPM). To systematically review research on the nature and impact of attitudes and knowledge towards CPM, a systematic literature search of 6 databases (the Cochrane library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science and EMBASE) was undertaken in July 2018. Additionally, hand-searching of Google, Google Scholar and reference lists was conducted. The inclusion criteria were adult (18-65 years of age), studies which included attitudes and knowledge towards CPM, studies written in English, published literature only and cross-sectional design. Included studies were critically appraised by two researchers independently using the Joanna Briggs Institute Analytical Cross Sectional Studies Assessment (JBI-ACSSA). A total of 36 studies met the inclusion criteria. The main finding was that among professionals, patients, caregivers and the public there were similar attitudinal barriers to effective CPM. The most commonly cited barriers were fear of drug addiction, tolerance of medication and side effects of opioids. We also found differences between professional groups (physicians versus nurses) and between different countries based on their potential exposure to palliative care training and services. There are still barriers to effective CPM, which might result in unrelieved cancer pain. Therefore, more educational programmes and training for professionals on CPM are needed. Furthermore, patients, caregivers, and the public need more general awareness and adequate level of knowledge about CPM.",2020,Menon_2022,0

ACE scores have been used to associate childhood adversity to a wide range of adverse health conditions over the life course, most notably substance-related disorders. Multiple studies have shown that the presence of elevated ACE scores predicts obesity in adulthood. However, a gap exists in the literature elucidating the pathways from childhood adversity to increased BMI in adulthood. We systematically reviewed these mechanisms as well as discuss novel plausible pathways. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science and after applying exclusion criteria identified 18 articles for qualitative analysis. The most commonly cited mechanisms linking ACEs to obesity are social disruption, health behaviors, and chronic stress response.

However, there has been limited implementation of such alternative models, and their efficacy is still inconclusive. Notably, little is known of the experiences of CYP and their parents with these alternative models and their level of satisfaction with the care provided. Therefore, the main aim of this review was to understand those experiences of the accessibility of alternative models to inpatient care, as well as overall CYP/parental satisfaction. A searching strategy of peer-reviewed articles was conducted from January 1990 to December 2018, with updated searches conducted in June 2019. The initial search resulted in 495 articles, of which 19 were included in this review. A narrative synthesis grouped the studies according to emerging themes: alternative models, tele-psychiatry and interventions applied to crisis, and experiences and satisfaction with crisis provision. The identified articles highlighted increased satisfaction in CYP with alternative models in comparison with care as usual. However, the parental experiential data identified high levels of parental burden and a range of complex emotional reactions associated with engagement with crisis services. Furthermore, we identified a number of interventions, telepsychiatric and mobile solutions that may be effective when applied to urgent and emergency care for CYP experiencing a mental health crisis.

The aim of our analysis was to determine the relative efficacy of ICIs versus available standard therapies [standard of care (SOC)] in subgroups defined by patients' age. Searching the MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Meeting abstracts randomized clinical trials were identified. Data extraction was conduced according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The measured outcome was overall survival (OS). Twenty-nine randomized clinical trials (18,839 patients) were selected. As for the distribution of patients by age, all but 3 of the selected studies considered young the patients younger than 65 years (n=10,832) and elderly those with 65 years and older (n=7723); 7 studies identified a third subgroup of very elderly patients aged 75 years and above (n=421). In elderly and very elderly patients ICIs significantly reduced the risk of death by 23% compared with SOC [hazard ratio (HR), 0.77; P<0.00001)]. On the contrary, a lack of a survival advantage of immunotherapy was observed in the subgroup of very elderly patients (HR, 0.85; P=0.39). When comparing the efficacy of ICIs between the 2 subpopulations (elderly vs. young), no significant difference in OS was observed (HR, 0.76; P=0.66). ICIs prolonged OS compared with SOC in both elderly and young patients affected by lung cancer, melanoma, and renal carcinoma, regardless of the age. In conclusion, ICIs (as monotherapy or combinations) significantly improved OS compared with SOC in both young and elderly patients with advanced cancers, regardless of the tumor type.

Part 2: emotional and behavioral consequences.,"Takero Terayama, Jun Shigemura, Yuki Kobayashi, Mie Kurosawa, Masanori Nagamine, Hiroyuki Toda, Aihide Yoshino","To compile the findings of studies assessing emotional and behavioral changes in the survivors of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, we performed a systematic review in August 2019 using four literature databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, and ICHUSHI). Peer-reviewed manuscripts, either in English or Japanese, were included in the searches. Sixty-one studies were retrieved for the review. Of these, 41 studies (67.2%) assessed emotional consequences, 28 studies (45.9%) evaluated behavioral consequences, and 8 studies (13.1%) evaluated both emotional and behavioral outcomes. The main research topic in emotional change was radiation exposure-associated risk perception, as reported in 15 studies. This risk perception included immediate health effects (eg, acute radiation syndrome) as well as future health effects (eg, future cancer and genetic effects). Lowered subjective well-being was reported in eight studies. Six studies reported perceived discrimination/stigmatization in the disaster survivors. The most critical behavioral change was an increase in suicides compared with residents in the whole of Japan or affected by the earthquake and tsunami, but not by the nuclear disaster. Increased rate of alcohol and tobacco use was reported, although the effect on one's health was inconsistent. As a conclusion, the Fukushima nuclear disaster survivors suffered issues in risk perception, well-being, stigmatization, and alcohol/tobacco use in the first 8 years after the disaster. The present study is important in order to better understand the emotional and behavioral responses to future nuclear/radiological disasters as well as other ""invisible"" disasters, such as chemical and biological public health crises.",2021,Menon_2022,0

We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the association between early life adversity and markers of inflammation in pediatric populations. To date, 27 studies have been published in this area representing a wide range of global populations and diverse methods of which nearly half were prospective, longitudinal studies. Of these 27, only 12 studies shared an inflammatory outcome with 4 or more other studies; 9 for CRP, and 6 for IL-6. The association between early life adversity and both CRP, z = .07 [.04, .10], and IL-6, z = .17 [-.07, .42], were small and only significant for CRP although comparable in magnitude to the effects observed in adult samples. Descriptively, the association between early life adversity and CRP appeared to be stronger in studies conducted in infants and adolescents compared with middle childhood. There was minimal evidence of publication bias for studies measuring CRP, but evidence of publication bias for studies using IL-6. Eight studies have looked at the association between early life adversity and stimulated inflammatory cytokines in vitro, and both the methods and results of these studies were mixed; the majority observed exaggerated production of inflammatory cytokines despite mixed methodological approaches that make comparisons across studies difficult. In summary, the evidence supporting an association between early life adversity and inflammation in pediatric samples is limited so far by the number of studies and their heterogeneous methodological approaches. More research that is grounded in a developmental framework and informed by the complexity of the innate immune system is needed in this area.",2020,Menon_2022,0

However, findings from trials vary substantially across studies. Therefore, current meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of L-Carnitine supplementation on exercise-induced muscle damage. An electronic search of the online literature databases (Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar) was performed up to November 2018. Either a fixed-effects model or a random-effects model (Diasorin-Liard) was used in order to estimate the effects size. Cochran's Q test and I2 tests were used to assess the heterogeneity among the studies. Funnel plot and Egger's regression test were also employed in order to assess the publication bias. Of 604 studies, seven eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this meta-analysis. Pooled data from seven studies showed that L-Carnitine resulted in significant improvements in muscle soreness (MS) at the five follow-up time points (0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours (h)) compared to placebo. Also, pooled data indicated that L-Carnitine significantly reduced creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin (Mb), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels at one follow-up period (24 h). However, no effects have been observed beyond this period. Our outcomes indicate that L-Carnitine supplementation improves delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and markers of muscle damage.

However, the effect of gender on the chemotherapeutic response and oncologic outcomes after radical cystectomy (RC) and perioperative chemotherapy remains to be elucidated. We performed a systematic literature search to identify eligible studies that had investigated the effect of gender on the chemotherapeutic response and oncologic outcomes after RC and perioperative chemotherapy. We identified 15 studies reported from 2008 to 2019. For the patients who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), female gender was not associated with a complete response (pooled odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-1.26) nor a complete or partial response (pooled OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.27). In addition, women experienced had less upstaging (pooled OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.14-0.68) at RC compared with their male counterparts. Moreover, female patients who had undergone RC and NAC were likely to have better disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality rates than were the male patients (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 and 95% CI, 0.44-0.98; and pooled HR, 0.49 and 95% CI, 0.29-0.81, respectively). For the patients who had undergone adjuvant chemotherapy, female gender was not associated with overall mortality (pooled HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.7-1.89), disease recurrence (pooled HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74-1.23), or cancer-specific mortality (pooled HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.81-1.43). Female patients with BCa seem to benefit more from NAC than do their male counterparts.

We systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane library and EMBASE databases from January 1, 1966 to March 1, 2019, to identify randomised controlled trials of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab and avelumab) that had available hazard ratios (HRs) for death according to PD-L1 status. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled overall survival (OS) HR and 95% CI among PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients. An interaction test was performed to evaluate the heterogeneity between the two estimates. A total of 24 randomised trials, involving 12,966 participants, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An OS benefit of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors was found in both PD-L1-positive patients (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.60-0.70) and PD-L1-negative patients (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74-0.91) even at the minimum cut-off value of 1%. Significant differences in the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors between PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative patients were noted at different cut-off values. Moreover, there was a positive dose-response relationship between PD-L1 positivity and OS benefit (HR for 1%, 0.58, [0.50, 0.67]; 5%, 0.52 [0.43, 0.64]; 10%, 0.50 [0.40, 0.63]). Subgroup analyses showed that these results were generally consistent, regardless of study design, line of treatment, treatment type, tumour type, PD-L1 staining cell type and median follow-up time.

The specific objective of this study was to systematically review the veterinary literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the clinical presentation, treatments reported and clinical outcomes from dogs with histologically low-grade cMCT and metastasis present at initial treatment. A total of 980 studies were screened with eight publications providing data on 121 dogs ultimately included. The most common treatments were surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy in 83/121 (69%) dogs; combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy in 17/121 (14%) dogs; chemotherapy alone in 12/121 (10%) dogs and surgery alone in 7/121 (6%) dogs. Dogs with distant metastasis (n = 22) experienced significantly shorter survival compared with those with regional lymph node (RLN) metastasis (n = 99; median 194 vs 637 days; P < .01). Two variables were significantly associated with increased risk of death: presence of distant (vs RLN) metastasis (hazard ratio = 2.60; P < .01) and not receiving surgery as a component of treatment (hazard ratio = 3.79; P < .01). Risk of bias was judged to be low in terms of selection and performance bias but high in terms of detection and exclusion bias.

However, the effect of POCs on long-term survival of gastric cancer patients following surgery is far from conclusive. This systemic review aimed to determine the impact of postoperative complications (POCs) on the long-term survival of patients following surgery for gastric cancer. A systematic electronic search of PubMed and Scopus was performed from inception to June 26, 2018 to identify studies that described the relationship between POCs and long-term survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) from each study were combined using a random-effects model. Sixty-four eligible studies with reported results for 46198 gastric cancer patients were included. A meta-analysis found a statistically significant difference in OS, CSS and RFS between gastric patients with unspecific POCs and no POCs, POCs ≥ Clavien-Dindo grade (CD) 2 and < CD2, major POCs and minor POCs, infectious and non-infectious complications, anastomotic and non-anastomotic complications, and cardiopulmonary and non-cardiopulmonary complications. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not significantly change the summary of OS risk estimates between patients with POCs and without POCs. No significant publication bias was observed for the same outcome.

The goal of this study is to detect the impact of RDW on the prognosis of PH.PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched from their inception to July 22, 2019 for relevant publications reporting the relationship between RDW and the prognosis of PH. A meta-analysis was performed, and the heterogeneity across the included studies was evaluated using I and Q statistics. We conducted sensitivity and subgroup analyses to detect sources of heterogeneity. In addition, potential publication bias was evaluated by Begg's and Egger's tests.In total, 1236 publications were retrieved, and 7 eligible publications with 666 PH patients were included in our meta-analysis. The results suggested that increased RDW can predict worse prognosis in PH (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.45). According to subgroup analysis, study design, region, various endpoints, time of follow-up, and patient age were not sources of heterogeneity. In addition, RDW showed prognostic value in retrospective studies (HR = 1.32, 95%CI 1.15-1.51) but not in prospective studies (HR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.78-1.67). Additionally, RDW may serve as a predictive biomarker of PH in Europe (HR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.18-1.49) but not in Asia (HR = 1.20, 95%CI 0.90-1.58). Further analysis indicated that the prognostic value of RDW was influenced by patient age (>44 years: HR = 1.34, 95%CI 1.17-1.55; ≤44 years: HR = 1.20, 95%CI 0.90-1.58) and follow-up (<3 years, HR = 1.36, 95%CI 0.53-3.47; ≥3 years, HR = 1.29, 95%CI 1.14-1.45).RDW provides important prognostic information for PH patients, and this measure may be used to optimize patient management and guide clinical treatment.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019122636.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The PUBMED, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were searched in December 2019 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. Studies were deemed eligible if they compared patients with HSPC with normal and low Hb levels to determine their ability to predict overall survival, cancer-specific survival, progression-free survival, and castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival. Formal meta-analyses were performed for these outcomes. The systematic review identified 25 studies including 6614 patients; 21 studies comprising 5782 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. Low Hb levels were associated with worse overall survival (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.29), cancer-specific survival (pooled HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24-1.72), progression-free survival (pooled HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28), and castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (pooled HR, 1.37; 95% CI: 1.18-1.57). Subgroup analyses revealed that low Hb levels were also associated with poor overall survival in patients with both ""high-volume"" (pooled HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.29-1.72) and ""low-volume"" HSPC (pooled HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.13-1.73). This meta-analysis revealed that low Hb serum levels in patients with metastatic HSPC were associated with increased risks of overall mortality, cancer-specific mortality, disease progression, and biochemical recurrence. Furthermore, Hb levels were independently associated with overall survival in the ""high-volume"" and ""low-volume"" HSPC subgroups.

Addressing wellbeing explicitly within HIV/AIDS policies could assist mitigation efforts. However, guidance on wellbeing measures to evaluate policies for YPLHIV is scarce. The aims of this mixed-methods review were to identify: i) key dimensions of wellbeing and ii) wellbeing measures that align to these dimensions among YPLHIV (15-24 years) in SSA. We searched six social science and medical databases, including grey literature. We included studies that examined correlates and lived experiences of wellbeing, among YPLHIV in SSA, from January 2000 to May 2019. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts and assessed methodological quality of included articles. We analysed quantitative and qualitative data using descriptive and meta-ethnographic approaches, respectively. Thereafter, we integrated findings using a framework approach. We identified 6527 citations. Of these, 10 quantitative and 30 qualitative studies were included. Being male, higher educational status, less stigma and more social support were likely correlates of wellbeing. Themes that shaped experiences suggestive of wellbeing were: 1) acceptance and belonging- stigma, social support; 2) coping; 3) standard of living. Our final synthesis found that the following dimensions potentially characterise wellbeing: self-acceptance, belonging, autonomy; positive relations, environmental mastery, purpose in life. Wellbeing for YPLHIV is multi-dimensional and relational. Relevant measures include the Personal Wellbeing Index, Ryff's Psychological Wellbeing Scale and Mental Health Continuum Short Form.

No direct comparisons have been performed among these treatment options. We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare and rank the available regimens for first-line treatment in terms of survival benefit and efficacy. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review statement, a systematic search of reported studies was performed in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE up to May 31, 2019. Network meta-analysis models were adjusted using the Bayesian method. Four randomized clinical trials, with a total of 3758 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Considering systemic therapy, 1880 patients had received sunitinib and 550, 432, 442, and 454 patients had received ipilimumab plus nivolumab (ipi + nivo), pembrolizumab plus axitinib (pembro + axi), avelumab plus axitinib (avelu + axi), and atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (atezo + bev).

Social exclusion, which can take many forms, increases the risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation. One important marker of social exclusion in young people is school absenteeism. Whether school absenteeism is associated with these adverse outcomes, and if so to what extent, remains unclear. To determine the association between school absenteeism and both self-harm (including completed suicide) and suicidal ideation in children and adolescents, we conducted a systematic review of observational studies. We conducted meta-analysis and report a narrative synthesis where this was not possible. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies showed that school absenteeism was associated with an increased risk of self-harm [pooled adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval 1.20-1.57, P = 0.01] and of suicidal ideation (pooled aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.42, P = 0.03). A small number of studies showed that school absenteeism had a longitudinal association with both adverse outcomes. Heterogeneity in the exposure and outcome variables, study design and reporting was prominent and limited the extent to which it was appropriate to pool results. School absenteeism was associated with both self-harm and suicidal ideation in young people, but this evidence was derived from a small number of cross-sectional studies. Further research into the mechanisms of this association could help to inform self-harm and suicide prevention strategies at clinical, school and population levels.",2020,Menon_2022,0

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and CENTRAL for relevant studies through October 2019. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effects model to the log-transformed data with a logistic distribution assumption. Bivariate meta-regression was performed to explore heterogeneity. In total, 13 studies with 999 CA adult patients were included. At the optimal threshold of 32, BIS obtained within 72 h of ROSC elicits a pooled sensitivity of 84.9% (95% confidence interval (CI), 71.1% to 92.7%), a pooled specificity of 85.9% (95% CI, 71.2% to 93.8%) and an area under the curve of 0.92. Moreover, a BIS cutoff < 12 yielded a pooled specificity of 95.0% (95% CI, 77.8% to 99.0%). In bivariate meta-regression, the timing of neurological outcome assessment, the adoption of targeted temperature management, and the administration of sedative agents or neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) were not identified as the potential source of heterogeneity. BIS retains good diagnostic performance during targeted temperature management (TTM) and in the presence of administrated sedative agents and NMBA.

There is no consensus on the potential long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of early SSRI exposure. Our aim was to determine whether there is an overall effect of perinatal SSRI exposure in animals on a spectrum of behavioral domains. After a comprehensive database search in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, we included 99 publications. We performed nine meta-analyses and two qualitative syntheses corresponding to different behavioral categories, aggregating data from thousands of animals. We found evidence for reduced activity and exploration behavior (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.28 [-0.38, -0.18]), more passive stress coping (SMD -0.37 [-0.52, -0.23]), and less efficient sensory processing (SMD -0.37 [-0.69, -0.06]) in SSRI- versus vehicle-exposed animals. No differences were found for anxiety (p = 0.06), social behavior, learning and memory, ingestive- and reward behavior, motoric behavior, or reflex and pain sensitivity.

Oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a high-affinity endogenous ligand of nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α), plays important physiological and metabolic actions. OEA is derived from oleic acid, a monounsaturated fatty acid, which has beneficial effects on body composition and regional fat distribution. The role of OEA in the modulation of food consumption and weight management makes it an attractive molecule requiring further exploration in obesogenic environments. This systematic review was conducted to assess the effects of OEA on the obesity management, with emphasizing on its physiological roles and possible mechanisms of action in energy homeostasis. We searched PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, ProQuest, and EMBASE up until September 2019. Out of 712 records screened, 30 articles met the study criteria. The evidence reviewed here indicates that OEA, an endocannabinoid-like compound, leads to satiation or meal termination through PPAR-α activation and fatty acid translocase (FAT)/CD36. Additionally, the lipid-amide OEA stimulates fatty acid uptake, lipolysis, and beta-oxidation, and also promotes food intake control. OEA also exerts satiety-inducing effects by activating the hedonic dopamine pathways and increasing homeostatic oxytocin and brain histamine. In conclusion, OEA may be a key component of the physiological system involved in the regulation of dietary fat consumption and energy homeostasis; therefore, it is suggested as a possible therapeutic agent for the management of obesity.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Leptomeningeal dissemination is a late-stage complication of intracranial metastasis and portends an extremely poor prognosis. An increased risk of leptomeningeal disease (LMD) from metastatic breast cancer compared to other cancer types after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been reported. Validation of this observation has significant public health ramifications. The aim of this study was to determine the consistency of this association in the available literature via formal meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature. Searches of seven electronic databases from inception to August 2019 were conducted following PRISMA guidelines and appropriate selection criteria. Prognostic hazard ratios (HRs) for LMD in breast cancer brain metastases derived from multivariate regression analysis were analyzed using meta-analysis of proportions. Our search strategy identified 8 studies meeting inclusion criteria which provided data on 2555 unique brain metastases patients treated with SRS. The risk of LMD in the setting of breast cancer brain metastasis was significantly greater compared to other histologic cancer types (pooled HR = 2.22; 95% CI 1.69-2.93; P < 0.001). Statistical assessment of small studies bias and heterogeneity were negative. Outcome certainty was low. Breast cancer brain metastases are associated with an increased risk of LMD compared to other cancer types after SRS. The certainty of this outcome will be improved with future prospective studies. Providers should factor this increased susceptibility for LMD in breast cancer brain metastasis to allow for appropriate risk stratification and the development of appropriate surveillance paradigms.,2020,Menon_2022,0

Specifically, few studies have employed the FITT-VP principle (i.e., Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type, Volume, and Progression) to characterize the exercise exposure, thus research is yet to specify which characteristics of exercise training benefit brain outcomes. To determine whether exercise training is consequential to cognitive and brain outcomes, we conducted a systematic review investigating the effects of exercise training on brain structure and function in older adults. PubMed and Scopus were searched from inception to February 2020, and study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A total of 24 randomized controlled trials were included. This systematic review indicates that older adults involved in exercise training may derive general benefits to brain health, as reflected by intervention-induced changes in brain structure and function. However, such benefits are dependent upon the dose of the exercise intervention. Importantly, current evidence remains limited for applied exercise prescriptions (e.g., volume, progression) and future research is needed to clarify the effects of exercise training on cognitive and brain outcomes in older adults.",2020,Menon_2022,0

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. This review is registered with the PROSPERO database and followed the suitability of the PRISMA protocol. The initial search resulted in 326 articles from the databases. After they were read, 8 articles remained, and the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Six of these 8 articles were classified as in vitro and 2 were classified as in situ. The regions of the implants evaluated ranged from the interface of the pieces to the occlusal upper access of the abutment. The implant connections evaluated the Morse taper, external connection, and internal connection. Meta-analysis of the quantitative data was performed at a significance level of .05. Cotton exhibited poor control of infiltration, even in combination with other materials. Isolated gutta-percha (GP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tape with composite resin (CR) or GP performed better as physical barriers. The best results for chemical barriers were observed by the application of 1% chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) gel, thymol varnish, and the deposition of Ag films onto the surface. The applied meta-analysis did not show a significant difference in comparison between the different types of implant connections (P > .05).

Animal CoVs, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, and the new virus named SARS-CoV-2, rarely infect and spread among humans. On January 30, 2020, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak of the resulting disease from this new CoV called 'COVID-19', as a 'public health emergency of international concern'. This global pandemic has affected almost the whole planet and caused the death of more than 315,131 patients as of the date of this article. In this context, publishers, journals and researchers are urged to research different domains and stop the spread of this deadly virus. The increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) applications has addressed several medical problems. However, such applications remain insufficient given the high potential threat posed by this virus to global public health. This systematic review addresses automated AI applications based on data mining and machine learning (ML) algorithms for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. We aimed to obtain an overview of this critical virus, address the limitations of utilising data mining and ML algorithms, and provide the health sector with the benefits of this technique. We used five databases, namely, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus and performed three sequences of search queries between 2010 and 2020. Accurate exclusion criteria and selection strategy were applied to screen the obtained 1305 articles. Only eight articles were fully evaluated and included in this review, and this number only emphasised the insufficiency of research in this important area. After analysing all included studies, the results were distributed following the year of publication and the commonly used data mining and ML algorithms. The results found in all papers were discussed to find the gaps in all reviewed papers. Characteristics, such as motivations, challenges, limitations, recommendations, case studies, and features and classes used, were analysed in detail. This study reviewed the state-of-the-art techniques for CoV prediction algorithms based on data mining and ML assessment. The reliability and acceptability of extracted information and datasets from implemented technologies in the literature were considered. Findings showed that researchers must proceed with insights they gain, focus on identifying solutions for CoV problems, and introduce new improvements.

Studies were deemed eligible if they compared cancer-specific survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with and without pretreatment laboratoryabnormalities. Formal meta-analyses were performed for this outcome. The systematic review identified 36 studies with 23,632 patients, of these, 32 studies with 22,224 patients were eligible for the meta-analysis. Several preoperative hematologic biomarkers were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival as follows: neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.29), hemoglobin (pooled HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.94), C-reactive protein (pooled HR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.26-1.66), De Ritis ratio (pooled HR: 2.18, 95% CI 1.37-3.48), white blood cell count (pooled HR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.07), and albumin-globulin ratio (pooled HR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.48). Several pretreatment laboratory abnormalities in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder were associated with cancer-specific mortality. Therefore, it might be useful to incorporate such hematologic biomarkers into prognostic tools for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.

A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of workplace interventions was conducted (PROSPERO, CRD42018094083). The PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched. RCTs from 2000 to 2017 and with employees (18-65 years) were selected. Then, intervention characteristics and work-related outcomes data were extracted. A total of 47 RCTs were included in the systematic review, and 19 RCTs (11 absenteeism, 7 productivity, and 5 work ability) were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the effectiveness of workplace interventions for absenteeism was -1.56 (95% CI, -2.67 to -0.44) and -2.65 (95% CI, -4.49 to -0.81) considering only moderate quality RCTs. In contrast, only a few studies of workplace interventions for productivity and work ability were included, which was insufficient for determining the effectiveness and best design for improving these work outcomes.

Relevant studies are sparse and inconsistent. Therefore, direct comparisons are difficult to perform and impractical. Hence, we summarized and compared the efficacy and safety of IPC and anticoagulants for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adults undergoing cranial or spinal procedures. Several electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials on the use of IPC and anticoagulants for thromboembolism prevention in neurosurgical patients, from inception to August 6, 2019. Studies reporting the selected endpoints were included in direct and Bayesian network meta-analyses to estimate the relative effects of the interventions. Overall, our analysis included 18 trials comprising 2474 patients. Both IPC (RR, 0.41; 95% CrI, 0.26-0.60) and chemical prophylaxis (RR, 0.48; 95% CrI, 0.28-0.68) were found to be more efficacious than the placebo in reducing the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Carolyn Cullinane, Ben Creavin, Donal Peter O'Leary, Martin J O'Sullivan, Louise Kelly, Henry Paul Redmond, Mark Antony Corrigan","The systemic inflammatory response plays a role in tumor progression and development. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biochemical marker of systemic inflammation and is increasingly gaining appreciation for its prognostic role in predicting breast cancer outcomes. Previous research has demonstrated that patients who achieve a complete pathologic response (pCR) to neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment have a more favorable disease-free survival. This study aimed to assess whether the NLR can predict pCR to neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer. A meta-analysis of 8 relevant studies was performed. The primary endpoint included pCR. Secondary endpoint included 5-year disease-free survival. Eight studies were included, reporting on 1586 patients. A total of 363 (22.88%) patients achieved pCR post neoadjuvant therapy. A lower NLR was associated with a greater rate of pCR (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-2.91; P = .0003). Only 4 studies produced data on disease-free survival. A lower NLR was associated with a higher 5-year disease-free survival; however, this did not achieve statistical significance (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-2.31; P = .02). Sub-group analysis of sample size, NLR value, and geographic location proved statistically significant in determining an association between NLR and pCR. This meta-analysis found NLR to be a predictor for pCR in patients with breast cancer. All of the studies reviewed were retrospective cohort studies. Adequately sized, prospective clinical trials are needed to understand if NLR could become an important prognostic indicator of pCR.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Despite the efficacy of the current treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD), including psychosocial interventions and medication-assisted therapy (MAT), many patients remain treatment-resistant and at high risk for overdose. A potential augmentation strategy includes the use of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS). These approaches may have therapeutic benefits by directly or indirectly modulating the neurocircuitry affected in OUD. In this review, we evaluate the available studies on NIBS in the context of OUD withdrawal and detoxification, maintenance, and cravings, while also considering analgesia and safety concerns. In the context of opioid withdrawal and detoxification, a percutaneous form of aVNS has positive results in open-label trials, but has not yet been tested against sham. No randomized studies have reported on the safety and efficacy of NIBS specifically for maintenance treatment in OUD. TMS and tDCS have demonstrated effects on cravings, although published studies were limited by small sample sizes. NIBS may play a role in reducing exposure to opioids and the risk of developing OUD, as demonstrated by studies using tDCS in an experimental pain condition and TMS in a post-operative setting. Overall, while the preliminary evidence and safety for NIBS in the prevention and treatment of OUD appears promising, further research is needed with larger sample sizes, placebo control, and objective biomarkers as outcome measures before strong conclusions can be drawn.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The relationship between ACEI/ARB use and COVID-19 infection was systematically reviewed. To identify relevant studies that met predetermined inclusion criteria, unrestricted searches of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were conducted. The search strategy included clinical date published until May 9, 2020. Twelve articles involving more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases were included. To estimate overall risk, random-effects models were adopted. Our results showed that ACEI/ARB exposure was not associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection (OR = 0.99; 95 % CI, 0-1.04; P = 0.672). Among those with COVID-19 infection, ACEI/ARB exposure was also not associated with a higher risk of having severe infection (OR = 0.98; 95 % CI, 0.87-1.09; P = 0.69) or mortality (OR = 0.73, 95 %CI, 0.5-1.07; P = 0.111). However, ACEI/ARB exposure was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to those on non-ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs (OR = 0.48, 95 % CI, 0.29-0.81; P = 0.006). In conclusion, current evidence did not confirm the concern that ACEI/ARB exposure is harmful in patientswith COVID-19 infection.

Previous studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the effect of vitamin C on reducing CRP or hs-CRP level. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to resolve these inconsistencies. Materials and methods: Related articles published up to August 2018 were searched through PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, ISI web of science, Embase, and Cochrane databases by relevant keywords. Clinical trials which examined the effect of either vitamin C supplementation or vitamin C-enriched foods on CRP and hs-CRP levels were included. A total of 11 studies with 14 data sets involving 818 subjects were included. Results Overall, the pooled analysis revealed that vitamin C could decrease CRP level relative to placebo group (Weighted mean difference [WMD]=-0.73 mg/L: 95% CI: -1.30 to -0.15, p=0.013) with a considerable heterogeneity (I2=98%, p<0.001). Moreover, subgroup analyses revealed that the beneficial effect of vitamin C on CRP level alternation only was found in male (p=0.003), non-smoker (p=0.041), healthy (p=0.029) and younger participants (p=0.010). Vitamin C could improve CRP level only at doses of less than 500 mg/day (p=0.009). Regarding hs-CRP changes, the pooled analysis did not show any significant effect of vitamin C (WMD=-0.65 mg/L: 95% CI: -2.03 to 0.72, p=0.35). This finding was confirmed by all subgroup analyses expect for high quality articles in which hs-CRP level was elevated after vitamin C supplementation (p=0.026).

We aimed to synthesize available epidemiologic studies to disentangle associations of cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and hyperlipidemia with ovarian cancer risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science for eligible studies. A random-effects model was applied for synthesis. Heterogeneity was evaluated by a Chi-squared test for the Cochran Q statistic and the I-squared value. Subgroup analysis was conducted by design, study locale, and ovarian cancer case number. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for studies adjusting for certain covariates or with superior quality. To explore the potential dose-response relationship, we further synthesized effect measures of moderate levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C. Twelve studies (five cohort and seven case-control studies) were included. In primary meta-analysis, the synthesized risk ratio (RRpool) and 95% confidence interval (CI) suggested that high cholesterol was associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk (RRpool 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.48, Cochran P value: 0.40, I2: 0.5%). High HDL-C was associated with a lower ovarian cancer risk (RRpool 0.61, 95% CI 0.40-0.94, Cochran P value: 0.06, I2: 63.7%). We obtained nonsignificant associations for other exposures. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results as the primary analysis. Only cholesterol showed marginally significant association in synthesis using moderate exposure levels (RRpool 1.18, 95% CI 0.99-1.42, Cochran P value: 0.51, I2: 0.0%). Our study suggests that high blood cholesterol is associated with an increased ovarian cancer risk, whereas the etiological significance of other exposures deserves more investigations.",2021,Menon_2022,0

Several studies have investigated the effects of cruciferous vegetables (Cruciferae) or their constituents on drug-metabolizing activity, as these vegetables form an important part of many peoples' diets. In general, the ingestion of cruciferous vegetables is associated with induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity in vivo; however, there is contention between reports, and the clinical significance of potential diet-drug interactions remains unclear. This study reports a systematic review, critical appraisal, and meta-analysis of the published literature in this area, and discusses the clinical significance of Cruciferae-enriched diets in the context of diet-drug interactions. Twenty-three dietary intervention trials with drug metabolism end points were identified across Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL). Cruciferous vegetables represented in the literature included broccoli, Brussels sprout, cabbage, cauliflower, radish, and watercress. A range of phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes and phenotyping metrics were represented in the literature. The meta-analyses performed demonstrated a significant effect on CYP1A2 and glutathione S-transferase-alpha (GST-α), with consumption of Cruciferae increasing the activities of these enzymes by 20-40% and 15-35%, respectively. The results herein suggest that patients undergoing pharmacotherapy with CYP1A2 or GST-α substrates could have altered drug exposure profiles if they regularly eat large or variable amounts of cruciferous vegetables.

The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize existing research on community- and home-based interventions designed to improve parenting and reduce risk of maltreatment for families with SENs, applying a program logic framework. The review includes studies that used preexperimental, quasi-experimental, and experimental designs. Twelve interventions were identified. Of the nine studies that used more rigorous experimental or quasi-experimental designs, five showed positive effects on at least one parenting or child maltreatment outcome, although some studies showed high risk of bias.

To understand nPEP awareness, uptake, and factors associated with uptake among MSM, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science for studies reporting nPEP implementation among MSM published before May 19, 2019. We estimated pooled rates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of awareness, uptake using a random-effects model. We identified 74 studies: 3 studies (4.1%) from upper-middle-income regions and 71 (95.9%) from high-income regions. The pooled rate of nPEP awareness and uptake was 51.6% (95% CI 40.6-62.5%) and 6.0% (5.0-7.1%), respectively. Pooled uptake rate was higher in upper-middle-income regions [8.9% (7.8-10.0%)] than in high-income regions [5.8% (4.8-6.9%)]. Unprotected anal sex was the most common exposure (range: 55.0-98.6%, median: 62.9%). Pooled completion of nPEP was 86.9% (79.5-92.8%). Of 19,546 MSM prescribed nPEP, 500 HIV seroconversions (2.6%) were observed. Having risky sexual behaviors and history of sexually transmitted infections were associated with higher nPEP uptake, whereas insufficient knowledge, underestimated risk of exposure to HIV, lack of accessibility, and social stigma might hinder nPEP uptake. Awareness and uptake of nPEP among MSM worldwide are low. Further efforts are needed to combat barriers to access nPEP, including improving accessibility and reducing stigma. Seroconversions post-nPEP uptake suggest that joint prevention precautions aside from nPEP are needed for high-risk MSM. More evidence from low-income and middle-income regions is needed.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify potential studies for inclusion. Three common atopic outcomes were included: asthma, eczema, and rhinitis.We found 693 titles, abstracts, and citations, and 6 studies were included in this analysis. A meta-analysis revealed that maternal OCP exposure was associated with higher odds of asthma (odds ratio [OR] 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.19; P = .014), rhinitis (OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.07-1.68; P = .011) during childhood, whereas there was no association with eczema (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.81-1.68; P = .383). This analysis was limited by the small number of studies included and the limited adjustments for the possible confounders in the studies.Current evidence suggests that maternal OCP exposure increases the risk for respiratory allergic diseases (asthma and rhinitis) in the offspring, but not for eczema.

Therefore, the characterization of major potential sources of human HEV exposure is important to inform risk assessment and public health policy. A systematic review was conducted, including a comprehensive search in six electronic bibliographic databases, verified by hand-searching reference lists of HEV reviews, and a grey literature search, of the broad research question 'what is the evidence of the association between predictors of human HEV exposure, and HEV IgG seropositivity, in non-endemic countries?' Using forms designed a priori, captured studies were appraised at first-level screening, second-level characterization, and third-level data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis yielded summary estimates of association between potential predictors and odds of HEV seropositivity. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the odds of HEV seroprevalence in specific groups characterized potential sources of HEV exposure. From 4,163 captured citations, 245 relevant studies underwent data extraction, investigating HEV seroprevalence or predictors in both healthy subjects and targeted patient groups. Across these groups, increasing age was a predictor of HEV IgG seropositivity. Both human immunodeficiency virus patients and haemodialysis patients had significantly increased odds of HEV seropositivity relative to the general population. Working with pigs, in forestry, or in hospitals, was significantly associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity, as were consumption of meat, pork or game meat, or hunting. Chronological time was not associated with HEV seropositivity within our data sets. Further study of the distribution of potential dietary or behavioural predictors between high and lower prevalence areas within non-endemic countries could improve our understanding of the relative importance of specific HEV transmission pathways.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Vertebral augmentation (VA), defined as either vertebroplasty and/or balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), is a minimally invasive surgical treatment to reduce pain and further collapse and/or renew vertebral body height by introducing bone cement into fractured vertebrae. Nonsurgical management (NSM) for OVCF carries inherent risks. Purpose To summarize the literature and perform a meta-analysis on the mortality outcomes of patients with OVCF treated with VA compared with those in patients treated with NSM. Materials and Methods A single researcher performed a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, or PRISMA, guidelines. Online scientific databases were searched in April 2018 for English-language publications. Included studies investigated mortality in patients with OVCF with VA as the primary intervention and NSM as the comparator.

Cutaneous T cell-mediated reactions classically occur more than 6 hours after drug administration and include life-threatening conditions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and hypersensitivity syndrome. Over the last 20 years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the pathogenesis of DHRs with the identification of human leukocyte antigens as predisposing factors. This has led to the development of pharmacogenetic screening tests, such as HLA-B*57:01 in abacavir therapy, which has successfully reduced the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reactions. We have completed a PRISMA-compliant systematic review to identify genetic associations that have been reported in DHRs. In total, 105 studies (5554 cases and 123 548 controls) have been included in the review reporting genetic associations with carbamazepine (n = 31), other aromatic antiepileptic drugs (n = 24), abacavir (n = 11), nevirapine (n = 14), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 11), dapsone (n = 4), allopurinol (n = 10), and other drugs (n = 5). The most commonly reported genetic variants associated with DHRs are located in human leukocyte antigen genes and genes involved in drug metabolism pathways.

The current scenarios of the issue, both rural and Latin American as urban and global, demand that the education on Chagas disease include all possible contexts: where there are insect vectors and where there are not; inside and outside Latin America; in rural, periurban, and urban areas; in formal and non-formal educational environments. We consider essential the requirement of both an integral approach that overcomes the biomedical aspect to include the multidimensionality of the issue and a dialogical educational perspective that allows individuals and communities to analyze, decide, and lead contextualized prevention and promotion actions regarding their health. In this study, we surveyed, described, and critically analyzed studies approaching the link education-Chagas disease in scientific publications from the last 15 years. We aimed at contributing methodological-theoretical elements to (re)think the development of educational research and experiences that truly help facing this issue.

Malassezia, an established symbiotic yeast that can evolve to a skin pathogen with opportunistic attributes, is a common source of folliculitis, especially when intrinsic (e.g. immunosuppression) or extrinsic (high ambient temperature and humidity, clothing) impact on the hair follicle and the overlying skin microenvironment. Our aim was to critically review the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of Malassezia folliculitis, to describe laboratory methods that facilitate diagnosis and to systematically review treatment options. Malassezia folliculitis manifests as a pruritic, follicular papulopustular eruption distributed on the upper trunk. It commonly affects young to middle-aged adults and immunosuppressed individuals. Inclusion into the differential diagnosis of folliculitis is regularly oversighted, and the prerequisite-targeted diagnostic procedures are not always performed. Sampling by tape stripping or comedo extractor and microscopic examination of the sample usually identifies the monopolar budding yeast cells of Malassezia without the presence of hyphae. However, confirmation of the diagnosis with anatomical association with the hair follicle is performed by biopsy. For systematic review of therapies, PubMed was searched using the search string ""(malassezia"" [MeSH Terms] OR ""malassezia"" [All Fields] OR pityrosporum [All Fields]) AND ""folliculitis"" [MeSH Terms] and EMBASE was searched using the search string: 'malassezia folliculitis.mp OR pityrosporum folliculitis.mp'. In total, 28 full-length studies were assessed for eligibility and 21 were selected for inclusion in therapy evaluation. Conclusively Malassezia folliculitis should be considered in the assessment of truncal, follicular skin lesions. Patient's history, comorbidities and clinical presentation are usually indicative, but microscopically and histological examination is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Adequate samples obtained with comedo extractor and serial sections in the histological material are critical for proper diagnosis.

This paper analyzes research dealing with food waste in the GCC countries (viz. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). It draws upon a systematic review performed on Scopus in January 2020. The paper covers both bibliometrics (e.g., authors, affiliations, journals) and research topics (e.g., causes, food supply chain stages, extent and quantity, food security, economic impacts, environmental implications, management strategies). A main finding of the review is the scarcity of data on FW in the GCC in general and in Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain in particular. Most of the selected articles address FW reuse and recycling (e.g., waste-to-energy conversion, compost production). Indeed, other FW management strategies, such as reduction/prevention and redistribution, are overlooked. The systematic review highlights that further research on FW in the GCC is highly needed with a focus on the identified research gaps such as causes and drivers, trends, magnitude and extent, environmental and economic impacts, along with implications of food wastage in terms of food security. Since food wastage is a common issue for all GCC countries, these research gaps should be addressed in a shared regional research agenda.",2020,Menon_2022,0
30809751,Malignant transformation of craniofacial fibrous dysplasia: a systematic review of overall survival.,"Zhi Li, Zijuan Wang, Haiyan Qian","The incidence of malignant transformation of fibrous dysplasia (FD) is very rare. Thus, the available knowledge of its characteristics, management, and survival is scarce. Here, we present a systemic review of fibrous dysplasia that had undergone malignant transformation. A comprehensive search was performed on PubMed electronic database. The survival rates and hazard ratios of age, gender, past history of previous radiotherapy, type of FD, and treatment were collected from the published articles and analyzed. Forty-eight cases were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patient's age, gender, past history radiotherapy, and type of FD did not influence the overall survival (OS). The Kaplan Meier analysis showed that the patients who had not received any treatment had poor prognosis with a median survival of 4 months. The patients that received surgery had significantly longer OS than that in the biopsy group. The prognosis of malignant transformation of FD is relatively poor, and surgery is the optimal treatment of choice. Nevertheless, the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant therapy to patient OS is still undefined.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Men are a unique population with whom many traditional workplace health promotion programs have had limited success. This systematic review posed the question do workplace health promotion programs improve sleep among men, and what program design features contribute to improving sleep among working men? Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHAL, Academic Search Complete and Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition and Google Scholar. Empirical research reporting non-pharmacological behavioral sleep programs and/or interventions for working men were eligible for review. 1049 articles were identified; 15 intervention studies were included: 13 interventions were delivered through workplaces, and two recruited workers to programs delivered outside of work. Interventions incorporated health education, stress reduction/relaxation, and/or physical activity components. Eleven studies reported positive findings for sleep health outcome(s) in men. A moderate level of evidence exists for sleep health programs with physical activity and stress management components. Evidence for the effectiveness of sleep health education programs was mixed. That only one study included a gender-sensitized intervention, where men's preferences shaped the content of a stress-reduction program which resulted in improved sleep quality, attests to the insufficient evidence and lack of gender-specific content and analyses. Next research steps should include considering cultural constructions of masculinity in program design in order to strengthen the appeal and engagement of men, and optimize health benefits for working men.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Constant exposure to cosmic radiation and circadian disruption are postulated to be the culprits of the problem. A systematic review was performed by 2 independent reviewers with predefined search strategy, in line with the PRISMA protocol. A total of 43 studies were identified using the preset keywords defined in the study protocol. After excluding irrelevant papers, 12 studies were included for pooled analysis. Ten studies evaluated the breast cancer prevalence in flight attendants, whereas 3 studies evaluated the breast cancer-related deaths. Pooled analysis found that, of the 45,111 flight attendants censored, 1061 (2.35%) had breast cancer. The standardized prevalence ratios were 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-1.59) and 1.09 (95% Cl, 0.37-1.60), respectively, when compared with the American and European general population. Pooled analysis of the 3 studies on breast cancer mortality found that, of the 44,508 flight attendants censored, 139 (0.32%) had breast cancer-related mortality. Standardized mortality ratios to the American/European general population were 1.8 (95% CI, 0.63-4.25) and 1.3 (95% CI, 0.47-3.15), respectively.

Information and communication technologies (ICT) are subject to constant and rapid development, and can contribute to the goal of an improved QoL for older adults. In order to utilise future ICT solutions as a part of an age-friendly smart environment that helps achieve personalised ageing with an increased QoL, one must first determine whether the existing ICT solutions are satisfying the needs of older people. In order to accomplish that, this study contributes in three ways. First, it proposes a framework for the QoL of older adults, in order to provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art literature and patents in this field. The second contribution is the finding that selected ICT solutions covered by articles and patents are intended for older adults and are validated by them. The third contribution of the study are the six recommendations that are derived from the review of the literature and the patents which would help move the agenda concerning the QoL of older people and personalised ageing with the use of ICT solutions forward.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The majority of the studies have multiple perspectives (epidemiology, biomechanics, performance), however only a few studies were able to identify risk factors or mechanisms that contribute to tennis injuries. Until now, there has not been a systematic literature review that identifies risk factors for tennis injuries. The objective of this review was to identify and critically appraise the evidence related to risk factors for upper limb injury in tennis players. A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, using a research question developed by the Patient Problem, (or Population) Intervention, Comparison or Control, and Outcome (PICO) methodology. The quality of the studies included was moderate to low, indicating prolonged tennis (exposure to tennis), scapular dyskinesis, muscle fatigue, scapulothoracic properties, shoulder kinetics or kinematics, skill level, and technique as risk factors for upper limb injury in tennis players. In this review, it is evidenced that the majority of tennis injuries are associated with overuse and a chronic time course, however, tennis injuries do not arise from a linear combination of isolated and predictive factors. Therefore, the multifactorial and complex nature of tennis injuries has to be further examined. The necessity of more randomized control trial studies is highly recommended.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Sleep hygiene is defined as a set of behavioural, environmental, or cognitive modifications to improve sleep, and is routinely clinically utilised as first-line treatment for insomnia in ADHD. The objective of this systematic review of the literature is to evaluate the effectiveness of sleep hygiene interventions for sleep difficulties in children with ADHD. Sixteen relevant articles met the inclusion criteria, involving 1,469 participants, with a mean age of 9.6 years, across 6 countries. Fifteen studies found that sleep hygiene interventions were effective in improving sleep, while one did not show any significant improvement. Definite conclusions on the effectiveness of the interventions are difficult to draw due to the limited number of studies and a high risk of bias. There is growing evidence to support the use of sleep hygiene interventions to improve sleep quality in children with ADHD and sleep disturbance. However, well-conducted clinical trials are required to strengthen the evidence.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32378769,Factors that affect health information technology adoption by seniors: A systematic review.,"Hamidreza Kavandi, Mirou Jaana","The number of seniors and prevalence of chronic conditions are increasing worldwide, resulting in more pressure on health systems. Health Information Technologies (HIT) present opportunities to support the healthcare needs of seniors. Although prior studies have investigated HIT and seniors, it remains unclear what factors significantly affect the adoption of different HIT by elderly people in the community. A Systematic Review (SR) was conducted between December 2017 and February 2018 (with a search update in 2018-2019) to critically appraise and synthesise existing evidence on HIT adoption factors among seniors. Following the PRISMA guidelines, five major databases were consulted (PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, Scopus and Web of Science). The inclusion criteria consisted of empirical studies, published in English, and reporting impacts of specific factors on HIT adoption among seniors in the community. A total of 41 studies were included in this review, mostly published between 2014 and 2017 in Europe and the US; the level of evidence in these studies was low to moderate. The factors that affect HIT adoption did not differ across types of technologies or age groups. The findings reveal that seniors adopt HIT that are perceived as useful and requiring low effort commitment; price/cost value were reported as adoption barriers. Social influence, facilitating conditions, senior-friendly product design, self-efficacy, Intrinsic Technology Quality, experience/training and technology anxiety may affect HIT adoption by seniors, although the evidence on these impacts remains weak and limited. Mixed and inconclusive evidence was observed on the impacts of socio-demographic variables, health condition, habit and privacy/security. Given the reported low level of HIT adoption among seniors, we call for more rigorous research in this area using a 'senior-centred' approach, which takes into account the discourse/interaction between seniors and their collective environment to better understand the factors that affect their technology adoption and address their needs.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Considering the potentially severe outcomes of the disease, vaccination is recommended for those at risk of exposure. During recent years, IC51 (IXIARO®, JESPECT®, JEVAL®) has increasingly been used to protect travellers from Europe and the USA. However, no systematic review exists that summarizes the currently available evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of this vaccine. We conducted a systematic review on the immunogenicity and safety of IC51, using the databases PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov (search date: 31 August 2019). Data extracted from included studies were grouped by outcomes and stratified by population and setting. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the RoB 2 tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. Due to high heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not performed. A total of 32 studies from 16 countries met the inclusion criteria (15 RCTs, 17 non-randomized studies). ROB was serious or high in the majority of studies. Seroprotection rates ranged from 93 to 100% in adults (seven studies) and from 91 to 100% in children (four studies). In the study involving adults aged 64 years and older, seroprotection was 65% with higher rates in persons who were previously vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis virus. Safety was investigated in 27 studies. Rates of serious adverse events were below 5% in all age groups, with the majority not being causally related to the vaccine. IC51 is a safe vaccine with good seroprotective abilities in persons aged >2 months to <64 years. The body of evidence, however, is weakened by a large amount of heterogeneity in study and clinical trial methodology. Further well-designed RCTs with special risk groups are needed.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The interconception period may be an important time to intervene. We systematically identified studies examining change in modifiable maternal exposures between pregnancies and offspring adiposity. We searched for longitudinal studies published between 1990 and 2019, which included measurements taken on at least two occasions in the period from 1 year prior to the conception of the first birth to the time of the second birth, and which included a measure of adiposity in second, or higher order, siblings. Age, ethnicity and genetics were not considered modifiable; all other factors including length of the interpregnancy interval were. Eleven studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Higher interpregnancy weight gain or loss, maternal smoking inception, mothers smoking in their first pregnancy and quitting, increasing the number of cigarettes smoked and longer interpregnancy intervals were positively associated with adiposity in second or higher order children. Vaginal birth after caesarean delivery was protective. Further research is needed to ascertain whether the risk of adiposity is fixed based on first pregnancy exposures or if interpregnancy change alters the risk for a subsequent child. This can inform the type and effectiveness of interventions for mothers prior to a subsequent pregnancy.",2020,Menon_2022,0

One subgroup that may be at particularly high risk of developing obesity is the offspring of parents who have undergone weight loss surgery (PWLS). To date, little research has focused on these offspring or their parents. This systematic review addresses this gap by integrating available literature and assessing the quality of the evidence. To be included, studies were required to have researched characteristics of the offspring of PWLS or parental feeding practices within this population. After review, 12 studies met inclusion criteria. Findings include evidence for heightened risk of obesity among children of PWLS. However, research suggests these children may experience positive, although time-limited, health outcomes after their parents' surgeries. Quality of the evidence was rated as low, primarily because of the lack of randomized controlled studies and information regarding available interventions specifically targeting this vulnerable population.

Given the unacceptable blood lead levels and the near ignorance or negligence of heavy metals in both diagnoses and management of diseases in Nigeria, it is feared that these metals are involved in the aetiogenesis of several ailments from preeclampsia, metabolic syndrome, cancer, etc. This is an insight on Nigerian fermented foods and their possible role as metal chelators in the management of the chronic heavy metal exposure in Nigeria. One hundred and five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Google scholar, PubMed and SCOPUS were searched for articles reporting fermented foods and probiotics in Nigeria. Only studies published in English Language were included, but there was no limitation in year of study. One hundred and five articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Studies from some African countries suggest that fermented foods of probiotics relevance have effectively shown metal chelation properties. Consumption of Nigerian fermented foods may hold a promise in checking the high body burden of heavy metals in Nigeria. Graphic abstract.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32526498,"Biomonitoring in firefighters for volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, persistent organic pollutants, and metals: A systematic review.","Michelle Engelsman, Leisa-Maree L Toms, Andrew P W Banks, Xianyu Wang, Jochen F Mueller","Firefighters are exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to combustion, with numerous biomonitoring studies completed that have assessed exposure. Many of these studies focus on individual classes of chemicals, with a few considering a broad range of systemic exposures. As yet, no review process has been undertaken to comprehensively examine these studies. The aims of this review are to: (1) ascertain whether biomonitoring studies pertaining to firefighters demonstrate occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, and metals; (2) determine and present results of biomonitoring studies; (3) provide any recommendations presented from the literature that may support exposure mitigation; and (4) suggest future study parameters that may assist in providing a greater understanding surrounding the occupational exposure of firefighters. A systematic review was undertaken with regards to firefighters and biomonitoring studies utilising the matrices of blood, urine, semen and breast milk. This yielded 5690 results. Following duplicate removal, inclusion and exclusion criteria screening and full text screening, 34 studies remained for review. Results of over 80% of studies analysed determined firefighters to experience occupational exposure. Results also show firefighters to be exposed to a wide range of toxic chemicals due to fire smoke; potentially exceeding the range of exposure of other occupations. As firefighters may face increased risk of health effects due to the additive, synergistic, and/or antagonistic effects of chemical exposure, all care must be taken to reduce exposure. This may be achieved by considering tactical decisions, increased personal hygiene, and thorough decontamination procedures. Future biomonitoring studies recognising and assessing the range of chemical exposure firefighters face would be beneficial.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32510405,Knowledge gaps in ecotoxicology studies of marine environments in Pacific Island Countries and Territories - A systematic review.,"Rufino Varea, Susanna Piovano, Marta Ferreira","The Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) are heavily dependent on the marine resources for food security, employment, government revenue and economic development, hence the concern about the potential exposure of these resources to pollutants. The main goal of this review was to identify ecotoxicology studies published that were done in PICTs. Four major gaps were identified: i) a quantitative gap, with low number of studies published on the PICTs; ii) a geographic gap, where ecotoxicology studies have unevenly covered the different PICTs; iii) a temporal gap, as no biological effect monitoring study has so far been published for the PICTs; and, iv) a pollutants gap, as all of the PICTs studies focused mainly on environmental monitoring studying on average two types of pollutants (heavy metals and pesticides) per PICT only. We suggest, therefore, the potential risk to the marine environment to be estimated by assessing the fate of pollutants via chemical and biological effect monitoring.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Exertional heat illness (EHI) remains a persistent problem for athletes and individuals. This threat remains despite numerous athletic position statements and occupational guidance policies. This review explores primary evidence that demonstrates a direct association between 'known' risk factors and EHI. What advances does it highlight? Primary evidence to support 'known' risk factors associated with EHI is not comprehensive. Furthermore, it is not evident that single individual factors predispose individuals to greater risk. In fact, the evidence indicates that EHI can manifest in non-hostile compensable environments when a combination of risk factors is prevalent.",2021,Menon_2022,0

Novel approaches exploring how to implement Systematic Review (SR) principles and methods for evaluating human health risks from environmental chemical exposures are needed. This paper reports and comments on a conceptual model that was developed as part of a mapping exercise for planning a SR, using aluminium-containing antiperspirants (Al-AP) and female breast cancer risk as a case study. The work explores how knowledge-assembly tools and pathway-oriented thinking developed in systems toxicology can be applied to support problem formulation (PF) in the context of SR. A conceptual model was developed to map out key research questions, working hypotheses, routes of exposure, toxicity pathways and endpoints, and related health outcomes. The model draws on the analytic framework for screening topics of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and builds on the concept of a ""source-to-outcome continuum"", integrating knowledge gained from exposure pathway concepts such as the Aggregate Exposure Pathway and Adverse Outcome Pathways. The model can be used as a central decision and prioritization tool for scoping and framing Population, Exposure, Control, Outcome (PECO) questions in a transparent and iterative manner; as a supporting tool to guide the whole SR process; and to lay down the methodological foundation of a SR on the Al-AP breast cancer topic. Logic modelling can be easily combined with systems or pathway-oriented thinking, and allows for a more structured, objective and transparent approach to PF when applying SR methods to the CRA context.",2020,Menon_2022,0

This study aimed to delve into the findings on exertional rhabdomyolysis (ER) and acute kidney injury (AKI) in endurance sports, emphasizing the diagnostic criteria used, physical and environmental contextual conditions in which ER and AKI are reported. Following PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis, topic related studies were searched digital sources (from 2009 to 2020). Studies with biomarkers of ER and AKI reported in endurance or ultra-endurance events were included. A total of 43 publications (sample = 813) were extracted, and 345 (43.5%) individuals were diagnosed with ER (creatinine kinase > 5000 UI/L) and 130 (16.39%) with ER + AKI (creatinine ≥ 1.88 mg/dL). Out of the total cases of ER + AKI, 96.92% were in ultra-endurance runners. There were inconsistences between studies in diagnosis criteria for ER and AKI, which represented a difficulty in the interpretation of the data. Increased levels of muscle and kidney injury immediately after endurance events were reported, but after 5.86 days these levels usually returned to baseline. There is a lack of knowledge around the potential of repeated ER and AKI predisposing to long-term chronic kidney disease. More accurate markers for subclinical and functional AKI diagnosis are needed in the analysis of kidney health after endurance events. ER and AKI are serious clinical problems with significant morbidity. Further research may be in order to help define future prevention strategies.",2021,Menon_2022,0

A systematic review.,"Eva Ramos, Víctor Farré-Alins, Javier Egea, Francisco López-Muñoz, Russel J Reiter, Alejandro Romero","There is a lack of effective therapies for stroke patients; its treatment is even more difficult considering the unexpected onset of the disease. In the last decade, melatonin has emerged as a promising neuroprotective agent which is able to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and with a low toxicity profile. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and critically review clinical and pre-clinical evidence related to melatonin's effectiveness as a stroke treatment. Together with a comparative dose extrapolation with those used in the selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and based on these data to discuss whether the administered doses correlate with those advisable in human patients. To address this purpose, we performed a systematic review of the available literature. A total of 529 records were screened with the selecting of six full articles containing RCTs that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The evidence drawn from these six reports was analyzed to identify remaining gaps, treatment efficacy, and to suggest future directions. The primary outcome reported was the reduction of the oxidative response; the secondary outcome was the increase of the survival rate of the patients in the intervention groups. Calculations derived from animal studies revealed that the translational doses to humans were substantially higher than those employed in the RCTs. The findings of this systematic review revealed that there are insufficient RCTs to prove melatonin's value in stroke patients. Nevertheless, the evidence is promising, and further clinical research may support the benefits of melatonin in stroke patients, if the adequate dose is administered.",2020,Menon_2022,0

To verify what types of interventions to manage occupational stress and burn out within neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have been introduced so far and to verify their efficacy among caregivers. PsycINFO (PsycINFO 1967-July week 3 2019), Embase (Embase 1996-2019 week 29) e Medline (Ovid MEDLINE(R) without revisions 1996-July week 2 2019) were systematically searched combining MeSH and free text terms for ""burn out"" AND ""healthcare provider"" AND ""NICU"". Inclusion criteria were interventions directed to healthcare providers settled in NICUs. Only English language papers were included. Six articles were included in the final analysis. All the studies reported an overall efficacy of the interventions in reducing work-related stress, both when individual focused and organisation directed. The analysis revealed low quality of the studies and high heterogeneity in terms of study design, included populations, interventions and their evaluation assessment. There is currently very limited evidence regarding the management of occupational stress and burn out within NICUs. The quality of available studies was suboptimal. The peculiarities of the NICUs should be considered when developing strategies for occupational stress management.

Methods A systematic search was conducted in bibliographic databases including PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection for English articles published from 1998 to 2018. The PICO strategy guided the assessment of study relevance and the bibliographical search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs in which (1) participants were adult workers with physically demanding work and MSD (including specific and non-specific MSD and musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, and discomfort), (2) interventions were initiated and/or carried out at the workplace, (3) a comparison group was included, and (4) a measure of MSD was reported (including musculoskeletal pain, symptoms, prevalence or discomfort). The quality assessment and evidence synthesis adhered to the guidelines developed by the Institute for Work & Health (Toronto, Canada) focusing on developing practical recommendations for stakeholders. Relevant stakeholders were engaged in the review process. Results Level of evidence from 54 high and medium quality studies showed moderate evidence of a positive effect of physical exercise. Within this domain, there was strong evidence of a positive effect of workplace strength training. There was limited evidence for ergonomics and strong evidence for no benefit of participatory ergonomics, multifaceted interventions, and stress management. No intervention domains were associated with ""negative effects"". Conclusions The evidence synthesis recommends that implementing strength training at the workplace can reduce MSD among workers with physically demanding work. In regard to workplace ergonomics, there was not enough evidence from the scientific literature to guide current practices. Based on the scientific literature, participatory ergonomics and multifaceted workplace interventions seem to have no beneficial effect on reducing MSD among this group of workers. As these interventional domains were very heterogeneous, it should also be recognized that general conclusions about their effectiveness should be done with care.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42018116752 ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=116752 ).",2020,Menon_2022,0

Optimal management and clinical outcomes of pregnant women with cryptococcosis are limited to case reports, as pregnant women are often excluded from research. Amongst pregnant women with asymptomatic cryptococcosis, no treatment guidelines exist. We prospectively identified HIV-infected women who were pregnant or recently pregnant with cryptococcosis, screened during a series of meningitis research studies in Uganda from 2012 to 2018. Among 571 women screened for cryptococcosis, 13 were pregnant, one was breastfeeding, three were within 14 days postpartum, and two had recently miscarried. Of these 19 women (3.3%), 12 had cryptococcal meningitis, six had cryptococcal antigenemia, and one had a history of cryptococcal meningitis and was receiving secondary prophylaxis. All women with meningitis received amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7-1.0 mg/kg). Five were exposed to 200-800 mg fluconazole during pregnancy. Of these five, three delivered healthy babies with no gross physical abnormalities at birth, one succumbed to meningitis, and one outcome was unknown. Maternal meningitis survival rate at hospital discharge was 75% (9/12), and neonatal/fetal survival rate was 44% (4/9) for those mothers who survived.

The aim of this study, therefore, is to review the available literature on the use of PPE in agricultural pesticide handlers in world regions, and also the factors associated with the use of PPE and pesticide safety practices in farmers and farm workers. Full-text articles published on PubMed, Scopus, and ISI databases between 1999 and 2019 were reviewed and the scientific evidence was evaluated. One hundred and twenty-one articles were eligible for inclusion in this quantitative synthesis: 110 evaluated PPE use in agricultural pesticide handlers, and 23 focused on factors affecting PPE use and pesticide safety practices. Considerable evidence was found to show that the most basic PPE worn among pesticide handlers in all world regions was a long sleeve shirt (66.1%), long sleeve trousers (71.1%), and a hat (47.3%). The lowest basic PPE worn was an apron (8.6%), goggles (24.3%), gloves (40.5%), boots (42.3%), and mask (43.2%). The PPE worn (except for an apron) was proportionally higher in farmers than in farm workers. There is considerable evidence to suggest that the significant determinants associated with PPE use and pesticide safety practices are as follows: (1) demographic factors (i.e. education/literacy level, experience of illness, income); (2) farm structure factors (i.e. farm size); (3) behavioral and psychosocial factors (i.e. contact with pesticides, perceptions, attitudes, awareness, norms and beliefs); and (4) environmental factors (i.e. information about pesticides, access to extension services, training program, and farm organization).

The focus of this systematic review was to investigate occupational brucellosis and to identify the main infection risks for each group exposed to the pathogen. Seven databases were used to identify papers related to occupational brucellosis: CABI, Cochrane, Pubmed, Scielo, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. The search resulted in 6123 studies, of which 63 were selected using the quality assessment tools guided from National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Case Report Guidelines (CARE). Five different job-related groups were considered greatly exposed to the disease: rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians and veterinary assistants, laboratory workers and hunters. The main risk factors and exposure sources involved in the occupational infection observed from the analysis of the articles were direct contact with animal fluids, failure to comply with the use of personal protective equipment, accidental exposure to live attenuated anti-brucellosis vaccines and non-compliance with biosafety standards. Brucella species frequently isolated from job-related infection were Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis and Brucella canis. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed using the case-control studies and demonstrated that animal breeders, laboratory workers and abattoir workers have 3.47 [95% confidence interval (CI); 1.47-8.19] times more chance to become infected with Brucella spp. than others individuals that have no contact with the possible sources of infection. This systematic review improved the understanding of the epidemiology of brucellosis as an occupational disease. Rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians, laboratory workers and hunters were the groups more exposed to occupational Brucella spp. infection. Moreover, it was observed that the lack of knowledge about brucellosis among frequently exposed professionals, in addition to some behaviors, such as negligence in the use of individual and collective protective measures, increases the probability of infection.",2020,Menon_2022,0

32206910,A Systematic Review of the Influence of Bolus Characteristics on Respiratory Measures in Healthy Swallowing.,"Gayathri Krishnan, S P Goswami, Balaji Rangarathnam","There have been a number of studies on the effect of bolus volume, consistency, texture, temperature and taste on the oropharyngeal swallowing physiology. However, its influence on the respiratory function associated with swallow is not well understood. This study aimed at systematically analysing and documenting the prevailing research literature on respiratory functions before, during, and after healthy swallows of boluses with varied characteristics. The PRISMA guidelines were followed for retrieval of relevant research. From among the 48,329 reports screened for inclusion criteria, 25 articles were included for data extraction. Each of these reports was evaluated for its design, methodology and reporting quality and also the level of evidence provided by them. The results revealed that the scientific evidence in this regard was restricted to level II. Majority of the studies included considered bolus volume as the variable than bolus consistency, taste or temperature. Expiratory phase was preferred surrounding the apnea irrespective of volume, consistency or taste but changed with temperature variations across age groups. The reports are equivocal on the duration of respiratory apnea, and length of respiratory cycles before and after the apnea. The temporal coordination of pharyngeal swallow events was found to be independent of bolus volume. This review concluded that bolus characteristics have differential effects on the respiratory functions during swallow beyond a 'central sensory threshold' level. Objective standardization of bolus characteristics may be the immediate requirement for generalization of future research findings in this direction.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32027461,Efficacy and tolerance of immune checkpoint inhibitors in transplant patients with cancer: A systematic review.,"Thibaut d'Izarny-Gargas, Antoine Durrbach, Mohamad Zaidan","Solid organ transplant (SOT) is frequently complicated by cancers, which render immunosuppression challenging. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have emerged as treatments for many cancers. Data are lacking regarding efficacy and rejection risk in the SOT population. We conducted a systematic literature review and analyzed 83 cases of immune checkpoint inhibitor use for cancer in SOT. Two thirds of these patients received anti-programmed death ligand 1 therapy, 15.7% received anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 therapy, and 10.8% received a combination. Allograft rejection occurred in 39.8% of patients, leading to end-stage organ failure in 71.0% of cases. Outcomes were similar across organs and immunotherapy regimens. The use of immunosuppressants other than steroids, time since transplant, and prior episodes of rejection were associated with the risk of rejection. The median overall survival of patients was 36 weeks. Most of the deaths were related to cancer progression. In nonkidney recipients, graft rejection was strongly associated with worse survival. At the end of the study, 19.3% of the patients were alive, free from rejection and tumor progression. This study highlights the difficult tradeoff facing oncologists and transplant specialists managing transplant recipients with cancer, and the need for prospective data and novel biomarkers for identifying the patients likely to benefit from immunotherapy in the SOT setting.",2020,Menon_2022,0
31272518,A Systematic Review of Techniques Employed for Determining Mental Health Using Social Media in Psychological Surveillance During Disasters.,"Dhivya Karmegam, Thilagavathi Ramamoorthy, Bagavandas Mappillairajan","During disasters, people share their thoughts and emotions on social media and also provide information about the event. Mining the social media messages and updates can be helpful in understanding the emotional state of people during such unforeseen events as they are real-time data. The objective of this review is to explore the feasibility of using social media data for mental health surveillance as well as the techniques used for determining mental health using social media data during disasters. PubMed, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES databases were searched from 2009 to November 2018 for primary research studies. After screening and analyzing the records, 18 studies were included in this review. Twitter was the widely researched social media platform for understanding the mental health of people during a disaster. Psychological surveillance was done by identifying the sentiments expressed by people or the emotions they displayed in their social media posts. Classification of sentiments and emotions were done using lexicon-based or machine learning methods. It is not possible to conclude that a particular technique is the best performing one, because the performance of any method depends upon factors such as the disaster size, the volume of data, disaster setting, and the disaster web environment.",2020,Menon_2022,0

A systematic search in MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to find studies in which a geriatric assessment was used to detect impaired geriatric domains or to address the association between geriatric assessment and survival or clinical outcome measures. The literature search included 4,629 reports, of which 54 publications from 44 studies were included. Seventy-three percent of the studies were published in the last 5 years. The median age of the patients was 73 years (range, 58-86) and 71% had a good World Health Organization (WHO) performance status. The median prevalence of geriatric impairments varied between 17% and 68%, even in patients with a good WHO performance status. Polypharmacy, nutritional status and instrumental activities of daily living were most frequently impaired. Whereas several geriatric impairments and frailty (based on a frailty screening tool or summarized geriatric assessment score) were predictive for a shorter overall survival, WHO performance status lost its predictive value in most studies. The association between geriatric impairments and treatment-related toxicity varied, with a trend towards a higher risk of (non-)hematologic toxicity in frail patients. During the follow-up, frailty seemed to be associated with treatment non-completion, especially when patients were malnourished. Patients with a good physical capacity had a shorter stay in hospital and a lower rate of hospitalization. Geriatric assessment, even in patients with a good performance status, can detect impaired geriatric domains and these impairments may be predictive of mortality. Moreover, geriatric impairments suggest a higher risk of treatment-related toxicity, treatment non-completion and use of healthcare services. A geriatric assessment should be considered before starting treatment in older patients with hematologic malignancies.",2020,Menon_2022,0

To better understand the health impacts of transportation initiatives, we conducted a systematic review of longitudinal health evaluations involving: a) bus rapid transit (BRT); b) bicycle lanes; c) Open Streets programs; and d) aerial trams/cable cars. We also synthesized systems-based simulation studies of the health-related consequences of walking, bicycling, aerial tram, bus and BRT use. Two reviewers screened 3302 unique titles and abstracts identified through a systematic search of MEDLINE (Ovid), Scopus, TRID and LILACS databases. We included 39 studies: 29 longitudinal evaluations and 10 simulation studies. Five studies focused on low- and middle-income contexts. Of the 29 evaluation studies, 19 focused on single component bicycle lane interventions; the rest evaluated multi-component interventions involving: bicycle lanes (n = 5), aerial trams (n = 1), and combined bicycle lane/BRT systems (n = 4). Bicycle lanes and BRT systems appeared effective at increasing bicycle and BRT mode share, active transport duration, and number of trips using these modes. Of the 10 simulation studies, there were 9 agent-based models and one system dynamics model. Five studies focused on bus/BRT expansions and incentives, three on interventions for active travel, and the rest investigated combinations of public transport and active travel policies. Synergistic effects were observed when multiple policies were implemented, with several studies showing that sizable interventions are required to significantly shift travel mode choices. Our review indicates that bicycle lanes and BRT systems represent promising initiatives for promoting population health. There is also evidence to suggest that synergistic effects might be achieved through the combined implementation of multiple transportation policies. However, more rigorous evaluation and simulation studies focusing on low- and middle-income countries, aerial trams and Open Streets programs, and a more diverse set of health and health equity outcomes is required.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32217755,Are workplace health promotion programmes effective for all socioeconomic groups? A systematic review.,"David van de Ven, Suzan J W Robroek, Alex Burdorf","Decreasing socioeconomic health inequalities is considered an important policy priority in many countries. Workplace health promotion programmes (WHPPs) have shown modest improvements in health behaviour. This systematic review aims to determine the presence and magnitude of socioeconomic differences in effectiveness and the influence of programme characteristics on differential effectiveness of WHPPs. Three electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews published from 2013 onwards and for original studies published from 2015 onwards. We synthesised the reported socioeconomic differences in effectiveness of WHPPs on health behaviours, and calculated effectiveness ratios by dividing the programme effects in the lowest socioeconomic group by the programme effects in the highest socioeconomic group. Thirteen studies with 75 comparisons provided information on the effectiveness of WHPPs across socioeconomic groups. Ten studies with 54 comparisons reported equal effectiveness and one study with 3 comparisons reported higher effectiveness for lower socioeconomic groups. Quantitative information on programme effects was available for six studies with 18 comparisons, of which 13 comparisons showed equal effectiveness and 5 comparisons showed significantly higher effect sizes among workers in low socioeconomic position. The differential effectiveness of WHPPs did not vary across programme characteristics. In this study no indications are found that WHPPs increase socioeconomic inequalities in health behaviour. The limited quantitative information available suggests that WHPPs may contribute to reducing socioeconomic inequalities. Better insight is needed on socioeconomic differences in effectiveness of WHPPs to develop strategies to decrease socioeconomic inequalities in health in the workforce.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Occupation-based approaches are also used but less widely promoted and their mechanisms of action not well-understood. Movement performed during purposeful activities and occupations may yield better motor performance than during nonpurposeful tasks. This review investigated the influence of engagement in purposeful activities and occupations on upper extremity motor performance in healthy and musculoskeletal populations. Databases were searched for studies in healthy or upper extremity musculoskeletal-injured adults that compared motor performance during purposeful activities against nonpurposeful movements. Twenty-one studies of moderate quality, conducted predominantly in healthy populations, were included. Upper extremity movement quantity and quality were enhanced when performed during purposeful conditions. Purposeful activities have potential to be used following injury to enhance movement and address motor impairments to a greater extent than is currently promoted.

Effective use of systematic-review methodology enables use of research evidence by decision makers. In addition, as reliance on systematic reviews increases, the required standards for quality of evidence enhances the policy relevance of research. Authoritative guidance has been developed for use of SR to evaluate evidence in the fields of medicine, social science, environmental epidemiology, toxicology, as well as ecology and evolutionary biology. In these fields, SR is typically used to evaluate a cause-effect relationship, such as the effect of an intervention, procedure, therapy, or exposure on an outcome. However, SR is emerging to be a useful methodology to transparently review and integrate evidence for a wider range of scientifically informed decisions and actions across disciplines. As SR is being used more broadly, there is growing consensus for developing resources, guidelines, ontologies, and technology to make SR more efficient and transparent, especially for handling large amounts of diverse data being generated across multiple scientific disciplines. In this article, we advocate for advancing SR methodology as a best practice in the field of exposure science to synthesize exposure evidence and enhance the value of exposure studies. We discuss available standards and tools that can be applied and extended by exposure scientists and highlight early examples of SRs being developed to address exposure research questions. Finally, we invite the exposure science community to engage in further development of standards and guidance to grow application of SR in this field and expand the opportunities for exposure science to inform environment and public health decision making.",2020,Menon_2022,0

While design, methodology, and replicability standards for GWAS are established, EWAS pose many challenges. We systematically reviewed published literature on EWAS to categorize scope, impact, types of analytical approaches, and open challenges in designs and methodologies. The Web of Science and PubMed databases were searched through multiple queries to identify EWAS articles between January 2010 and December 2018, and a systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting standard. Twenty-three articles met our inclusion criteria and were included. For each study, we categorized the data sources, the definitions of study outcomes, the sets of environmental variables, and the data engineering/analytical approaches, e.g. neighborhood definition, variable standardization, handling of multiple hypothesis testing, model selection, and validation. We identified limited exploitation of data sources, high heterogeneity in analytical approaches, and lack of replication.

For comparison, a systematic review was also performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science using the keywords 'rabies,' 'bat' and 'exposure.' There were three MBE events in Rhode Island between 2010 and 2016 in which groups of individuals were asleep during the potential exposure. As a result, RIDOH provided PEP to those involved in the event. In a systematic review of 12 published reports, a variety of settings were involved in MBEs: camping sites, a domestic flight, a neonatal intensive care unit and dormitories. The number of potential rabies exposures ranged from five to 1,429 people. PEP recommendations for assessed persons ranged from 0% to 100% across events (median 21%).

The etiology of the disease and its related complications are yet to be clarified. It has been hypothesized that environmental factors, including pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and the internal factors such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), may be the most important inducers/stimulators of the disorder and its related complications. Previous investigations proved that pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) are the main sensors for the PAMPs and DAMPs. Therefore, it seems that the PRRs have been considered to be the plausible molecules participating in the etiology of MS. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been the widely studied PRRs and their roles have been documented in human-related diseases. TLR4 is the main PRR expressed on the cell surface of several immune cells including macrophages and dendritic cells. Several investigations reported that TLR4 to be the main molecule involved in the pathogenesis of pro-inflammatory based diseases.

Although conceptual links between self-compassion and trauma are apparent, a review has not been completed to examine whether this association is supported by empirical research findings. To systematically summarize knowledge on the association between trauma and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and self-compassion. Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, PubMed, Ovid Medline, Web of Science, Embase, and PILOTS databases, and papers reporting a direct analysis on the relationship between these constructs were identified. The search yielded 35 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Despite considerable heterogeneity in study design, sample, measurement, and trauma type, there was consistent evidence to suggest that increased self-compassion is associated with less PTSD symptomatology and some evidence to suggest that reduced fear of self-compassion is associated with less PTSD symptomatology. There was tentative evidence to suggest that interventions based, in part or whole, on a self-compassion model potentially reduce PTSD symptoms. Although findings are positive for the association between increased self-compassion and reduced PTSD symptoms, the precise mechanism of these protective effects is unknown. Prospective and longitudinal studies would be beneficial in clarifying this.

A systematic review of reviews.,"Peter Gelius, Sven Messing, Lee Goodwin, Diana Schow, Karim Abu-Omar","The importance of policy for promoting physical activity (PA) is increasingly recognized by academics, and there is a push by national governments and international institutions for PA policy development and monitoring. However, our knowledge about which policies are actually effective to promote PA remains limited. This article summarizes the currently available evidence by reviewing existing reviews on the subject. Building on results from a previous scoping review on different types of PA-related evidence, we ran searches for combinations of the terms ""physical activity"", ""evidence"", ""effect"", ""review"", and ""policy"" in six different databases (PubMed, Scopus, SportDiscus, PsycInfo, ERIC, and IBSS). We used EPPI Reviewer 4 to further process the results and conduct an in-depth analysis. We identified 57 reviews providing evidence on 53 types of policies and seven broader groups of policies. Reviews fell into four main categories: 1) setting- and target group-specific; 2) urban design, environment and transport; 3) economic instruments; and 4) broad-range perspective. Results indicate that there is solid evidence for policy effectiveness in some areas (esp. school-based and infrastructural policies) but that the evidence in other areas is insufficient (esp. for economic policies). The available evidence provides some guidance for policy-makers regarding which policies can currently be recommended as effective. However, results also highlight some broader epistemological issues deriving from the current research. This includes the conflation of PA policies and PA interventions, the lack of appropriate tools for benchmarking individual policies, and the need to critically revisit research methodologies for collating evidence on policies.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Safety incidents caused by uncertainty and unexpected events in construction refurbishment systems are difficult to control using conventional safety management techniques. Resilience engineering (RE) is proposed as an alternative to traditional safety management approaches. It presents a successful safety management methodology designed to deal with uncertainty in high-risk work environments. Despite the fact that RE resides in the safety domain, there is no common set of RE indicators to measure and assess resilient in the work environment. The main aim of this research is to explore RE indicators that have been identified as important in developing and assessing the resilient work environment in high-risk industries, particularly in construction refurbishment. Indicators have been attained through a systematic literature review of research and scholarly articles published between the years 2004 and 2019. The literature review explored RE indicators in various industries. Descriptive analysis and co-occurrence-based network visualization were used for data analysis. The findings revealed 28 RE indicators in 11 different high-risk industries. The results show that the four commonly used indicators were: top-management commitment, awareness, learning, and flexibility, all of which have a strong relationship with RE. The findings of this study are useful for stakeholders when making decisions concerning the most important RE indicators in the context of their research or practice as this would avoid the ambiguity and disparity in the identification of RE indicators.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Studies meeting the following criteria were included in the analysis: peer-reviewed statistical studies or reports detailing management of potential traumatic spinal injury in RSE, civilian, and military environments; as well as consensus clinical guidelines, academic center, or professional association protocols or policy statements detailing management of potential traumatic spinal injury in RSE, civilian, and military environments; statistical analysis; and subsequent management of spinal injuries after mass-casualty incidents, in complex humanitarian events or conflict zones, low-to middle-income countries, or prolonged transport times published by government and non-government organizations. Studies excluded from consideration were those not related to a patient with a potential traumatic spinal injury after a mass-casualty incident, in complex humanitarian event or conflict zones, in low-to middle-income countries, or with prolonged transport times.There were one thousand twenty-nine (1029) studies initially identified. After removal of duplicates, nine hundred-nineteen (919) were screened with eight hundred sixty-three (863) excluded. The remaining fifty-six (56) received further review with fourteen (14) selected studies achieving inclusion. The reviewed articles comprised six (6) types of studies and represented research from institutions in seven (7) different countries (Israel, United States, Haiti, Wales, Pakistan, China, and Iran). Thirteen (13) references were case reports/narrative reviews, policy statements, retrospective observational studies, narrative literature reviews, scoping reviews, and one systematic review. The majority of literature describing spinal cord injury was predominantly associated with earthquakes and blast-related disasters. There were no SI evidence-based clinical guidelines (EBG) in RSE.

MPs alone and in combination with pollutants can potentially cause significant harm to organisms and human beings. Weathering of MPs under various environmental stresses increases the uncertainty of their environmental fates. Compared with field surveys, laboratory simulation experiments are appropriate to simplify the research procedures and investigate the mechanisms. In this review, the effects of abrasion, solar radiation, chemical and thermal oxidation, microbial adhesion and colonization, and other environmental factors on the MPs and the relative laboratory simulation methods were summarized and discussed. Photo-oxidation and abrasion are the most appliable methods due to easy operation and adjustable weathering degree. Furthermore, the structural and components changes in weathering process and the applied characterization methods were generalized. In addition, one of important environmental behaviors, adsorption of the weathered MPs towards two typical pollutants was analyzed. Finally, three priorities for research were proposed. This paper conducts systematic summarized of the MPs weathering process and provides a reference for future studies to accurately determine the environmental risks of weathering MPs.",2020,Menon_2022,0

We systematically reviewed data on this topic by searching Medline, Cochrane, and Clinicaltrials.gov to identify randomized clinical trials (RCT) and observational studies that assessed the efficacy and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, and bupropion in patients with stroke and TIA. We included studies that reported rates of smoking cessation, worsening or recurrent cerebrovascular disease, seizures, or neuropsychiatric events. We identified 2 RCTs and 6 observational studies; 3 included ischemic stroke and TIA, 2 subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and 3 did not specify. Four studies assessed efficacy; cessation rates ranged from 33% to 66% with pharmacological therapy combined with behavioral interventions versus 15% to 46% without, but no individual study demonstrated a statistically significant benefit. Safety data for varenicline and buopropion in ischemic stroke were scarce. Patients with SAH who received NRT had more seizures (9% vs 2%; P = 0.024) and delirium (19% vs 7%; P = 0.006) in one study, but less frequent vasospasm in 3 studies. In conclusion, combined with behavioral interventions, smoking-cessation therapies resulted in numerically higher cessation rates.

To understand recent parent's attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions regarding infant feeding, we sought to systematically identify and synthesize original qualitative research findings. Following the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) framework, electronic databases were searched with a priori terms applied to title/abstract fields and limited to studies published in English from 2015 to 2019, inclusive. Study quality assessment was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist, and thematic analyses performed. Of 73 studies meeting inclusion criteria, four major themes emerged. (1) Breastfeeding is best for an infant; (2) Distinct attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of mothers that breastfeed, and those that could not or chose not to breastfeed, are evident; (3) Infant feeding behaviors are influenced by the socio-cultural environment of the family, and (4) Parent's expectations of education and support addressing personal infant feeding choices from health care providers are not always met.

It is used in various dental domains such as implantology, surgery, periodontology, esthetics and prevention. The aim of this study is to provide a wide understanding of nano-HA and to promote treatments based on nanomaterials in dentistry. A search in two data bases, Scopus, and PubMED, was conducted over a 5 years period. We chose a 5 years period because this revealed the most recent published studies with the key words 'nano-HA' and 'dentistry'. A number of 32 studies were included in this systematic review. In implantology the main use of nano-HA was as a coating material for titanium implants and its effect was assessed in the matter of osteointegration and inflammatory response as well as antibacterial activity. In tissue engineering the use of nano-HA was directed to surgery and periodontology and this material was assessed mainly as a grafting material. In esthetics and prevention its use was mainly focused on dentinal hypersensitivity treatment, remineralizing potential and as bleaching co-agent. Nano-HA is a relatively novel material with outstanding physical, chemical, mechanical and biological properties that makes it suitable for multiple interventions.

30866745,Child Abuse in Natural Disasters and Conflicts: A Systematic Review.,"Hamed Seddighi, Ibrahim Salmani, Mohhamad Hossein Javadi, Saeideh Seddighi","Violence against children affects a significant portion of youth around the world. Emergencies and natural disasters escalate the risk due to weakened child protection systems and disruption of preventative mechanisms. In this systematic review, 692 related papers were searched in various databases in the initial search. After review, 11 papers were finally selected for full review. These papers were selected based on publication date, relevance to emergencies, their geographical area type of violence, age of subjects, and their gender. Most families affected by natural disasters, especially those in lower socioeconomic status, face greater social and economic pressures. The families that are more vulnerable to loss of food and shelter commit violence against children more frequently. On the other hand, while the rate of violence increases in emergencies, the reported rate of violence is less than the actual rate due to lack of required infrastructure and reporting mechanisms. The emergency housing increased risk of some types of child abuse. The history of exposure to violence, parental substance abuse, poverty, and child labor were predictors of increased violence against children in emergency situations. Sexual violence against girls after conflicts and physical violence against boys after emergencies are common forms of violence. Poverty as another predictor exposes children to more violence due to limited family economic resources and support. Given the identified predictors of violence, humanitarian organizations can come closer to providing appropriate plans to reduce the risk during and postdisaster.",2021,Menon_2022,0

The objectives of this MiniReview were to investigate the evidence base for drug-drug interactions between clarithromycin and currently marketed statins and to present management strategies for these drug combinations. We conducted a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines with English language studies retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE (from inception through March 2019). We included 29 articles (16 case reports, 5 observational, 5 clinical pharmacokinetic and 3 in vitro studies). Based on mechanistic/clinical studies involving clarithromycin or the related macrolide erythromycin (both strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and of hepatic statin uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), clarithromycin is expected to substantially increase systemic exposure to simvastatin and lovastatin (>5-fold increase in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)), moderately increase AUCs of atorvastatin and pitavastatin (2- to 4-fold AUC increase) and slightly increase pravastatin exposure (≈2-fold AUC increase) while having little effect on fluvastatin or rosuvastatin. The 16 cases of statin-clarithromycin adverse drug reactions (rhabdomyolysis (n = 14) or less severe clinical myopathy) involved a CYP3A4-metabolized statin (simvastatin, lovastatin or atorvastatin). In line, a cohort study found concurrent use of clarithromycin and CYP3A4-metabolized statins to be associated with a doubled risk of hospitalization with rhabdomyolysis or other statin-related adverse events as compared with azithromycin-statin co-administration. If clarithromycin is necessary, we recommend (a) avoiding co-administration with simvastatin, lovastatin or atorvastatin; (b) withholding or dose-reducing pitavastatin; (c) continuing pravastatin therapy with caution, limiting pravastatin dose to 40 mg daily; and (d) continuing fluvastatin or rosuvastatin with caution.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Searches were conducted in CINAHL, AMED, EMBASE, and Maternity and Infant Care from inception to March 2018. Observational studies assessing the primary outcome (adherence to dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations) and/or secondary outcome (factors associated with adherence) were eligible. Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional studies. Men or women (aged ≥18 years) who identified as trying/intending to conceive or were pregnant. Eighteen studies were included. The quality of studies was fair (44%) to good (56%). Most studies indicated preconceptual and pregnant women do not meet recommendations for vegetable, cereal grain, or folate intake. Pregnant women did not meet iron or calcium intake requirements in 91% and 55% of included studies, respectively, and also exceeded fat intake recommendations in 55% of included studies. Higher level education was associated with improved guideline adherence in pregnant women, whereas older age and non-smoking status were associated with greater guideline adherence in preconceptual and pregnant women. The findings of this review suggest that preconceptual and pregnant women may not be meeting the minimum requirements stipulated in dietary guidelines and/or nutritional recommendations. This could have potential adverse consequences for pregnancy and birth outcomes and the health of the offspring.

This branch of technology has been incorporated into various fields of dentistry ranging from diagnosis to prevention and treatment. The latter involves application of numerous biomaterials that help in restoration of esthetic and functional dentition. Over the past decade, these materials were modified through the incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NP) like silver (Ag), gold (Au), titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and zirconia (Zr). They enhanced antimicrobial, mechanical, and regenerative properties of these materials. However, lately, the toxicological implications of these nanometal particles have been realized. They were associated with cytotoxicity, genotoxicity altered inflammatory processes, and reticuloendothelial system toxicity. As dental biomaterials containing metal NPs remain functional in oral cavity over prolonged periods, it is important to know their toxicological effects in humans.

One proposed solution to the problem has been e-cigarettes; however, because they are a relatively new product in the market, little is known about their potential health impacts. Furthermore, e-cigarettes continue to evolve at a rapid rate, making it necessary to regularly review and summarize available studies. Although e-cigarettes are marketed as a smoking cessation tool by some manufacturers, the reality is that many nonsmokers, including youth, are using them. This review focuses on two major demographic groups (smokers and nonsmokers) and evaluates the most recent data (early 2017 to mid 2019) regarding the potential health effects of e-cigarettes. We assessed peer-reviewed studies on the health impacts of e-cigarettes, with a particular focus on common questions asked by policy makers, clinicians, and scientists: (1) What are the effects of e-cigarettes compared with air/not smoking?; (2) Is there any direct evidence of harm or benefit to humans?; (3) Is there a risk from secondhand exposure?; (4) What are the risks and/or benefits of e-cigarettes compared with tobacco cigarette use?; (5) Are there risks or benefits to specific populations (eg, people with COPD or asthma, pregnant women [and their offspring])?; (6) What are the effects of flavoring chemicals?; (7) What are the effects of including nicotine in e-liquids?; (8) How often is nicotine concentration labeling incorrect?; and (9) What are the risks when e-cigarettes explode?",2020,Menon_2022,0

In addition, a pooled odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.42-2.71) was obtained for sex (males with reference to females). However, the association between other factors, such as dietary factors and smoking, and acne presentation or severity was less clear, with inconsistent results between studies. Thus, further research is required to understand how these factors may influence the development and severity of acne. This study summarizes the potential factors that may affect the risk of acne presentation or severe acne and can help researchers and clinicians to understand the epidemiology of acne and severe acne. Furthermore, the findings can direct future acne research, with the hope of gaining insight into the pathophysiology of acne so as to develop effective acne treatments.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Here, we conducted the first systematic review of human studies linking childhood maltreatment to DNAm. In total, 72 studies were included in the review (2008-2018). The majority of extant studies (i) were based on retrospective data in adults, (ii) employed a candidate gene approach (iii) focused on global maltreatment, (iv) were based on easily accessible peripheral tissues, typically blood; and (v) were cross-sectional. Two-thirds of studies (n = 48) also examined maltreatment-related outcomes, such as stress reactivity and psychiatric symptoms. While findings generally support an association between childhood maltreatment and altered patterns of DNAm, factors such as the lack of longitudinal data, low comparability across studies as well as potential genetic and 'pre-exposure' environmental confounding currently limit the conclusions that can be drawn. Key challenges are discussed and concrete recommendations for future research are provided to move the field forward.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The current paper reviews the literature on exposure interventions for eating disorders, including studies (N = 60) on exposure and response prevention (ERP), in vivo feared food exposure, mirror exposure, family-based treatment with exposure, and virtual reality exposure therapy. Mirror exposure alone or in the context of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can decrease body dissatisfaction. The few controlled trials on ERP for binge and purge cues show only marginal benefit of ERP for binge or purge cues over and above other treatment methods such as CBT. In vivo exposure to feared foods may decrease state anxiety and increase caloric intake and body mass index, but research is limited. Virtual reality exposure could improve accessibility and feasibility of exposures in the clinical setting. A significant portion of the trials incorporated exposures into an overarching treatment such as CBT, body image therapy, or inpatient treatment, so the effects of exposure itself are difficult to parse apart. We discuss the state of the current literature in the context of learning theory and offer insights into new approaches to the application of exposure therapy in an eating disordered population.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32339201,Reservoirs and transmission routes of leprosy; A systematic review.,"Thomas Ploemacher, William R Faber, Henk Menke, Victor Rutten, Toine Pieters","Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) and the more recently discovered Mycobacterium lepromatosis (M. lepromatosis). The two leprosy bacilli cause similar pathologic conditions. They primarily target the skin and the peripheral nervous system. Currently it is considered a Neglected Tropical Disease, being endemic in specific locations within countries of the Americas, Asia, and Africa, while in Europe it is only rarely reported. The reason for a spatial inequality in the prevalence of leprosy in so-called endemic pockets within a country is still largely unexplained. A systematic review was conducted targeting leprosy transmission research data, using PubMed and Scopus as sources. Publications between January 1, 1945 and July 1, 2019 were included. The transmission pathways of M. leprae are not fully understood. Solid evidence exists of an increased risk for individuals living in close contact with leprosy patients, most likely through infectious aerosols, created by coughing and sneezing, but possibly also through direct contact. However, this systematic review underscores that human-to-human transmission is not the only way leprosy can be acquired. The transmission of this disease is probably much more complicated than was thought before. In the Americas, the nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) has been established as another natural host and reservoir of M. leprae. Anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission have both been proposed as modes of contracting the disease, based on data showing identical M. leprae strains shared between humans and armadillos. More recently, in red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) with leprosy-like lesions in the British Isles M. leprae and M. lepromatosis DNA was detected. This finding was unexpected, because leprosy is considered a disease of humans (with the exception of the armadillo), and because it was thought that leprosy (and M. leprae) had disappeared from the United Kingdom. Furthermore, animals can be affected by other leprosy-like diseases, caused by pathogens phylogenetically closely related to M. leprae. These mycobacteria have been proposed to be grouped as a M. leprae-complex. We argue that insights from the transmission and reservoirs of members of the M. leprae-complex might be relevant for leprosy research. A better understanding of possible animal or environmental reservoirs is needed, because transmission from such reservoirs may partly explain the steady global incidence of leprosy despite effective and widespread multidrug therapy. A reduction in transmission cannot be expected to be accomplished by actions or interventions from the human healthcare domain alone, as the mechanisms involved are complex. Therefore, to increase our understanding of the intricate picture of leprosy transmission, we propose a One Health transdisciplinary research approach.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and SCOPUS for studies assessing fetal cardiac function in drug-exposed human pregnancies. Risk of bias was assessed by the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBIN-I) tool. Results We included 32 studies on eight different drug groups. They included 51 outcome variables, which were all based on ultrasound techniques primarily assessing systolic function: pulsed wave Doppler, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and B- and M-mode. Overall, the risk of bias was moderate. β2 agonists increased the systolic velocity in the ductus arteriosus and the fetal heart rate. β-blockers caused unchanged or decreased systolic velocity of the pulmonary trunk. Corticosteroids increased the velocity in the ductus arteriosus. Furthermore, in growth-restricted fetuses with an increased myocardial performance index (MPI') on the right side, corticosteroids normalized this variable. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but not acetylsalicylic acid, increased the flow velocities in the ductus arteriosus, decreased the shortening fraction and increased the end-diastolic ventricular diameters. Metformin and insulin normalized the diastolic strain and global longitudinal strain in diabetic pregnancies. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) exposure increased the E/A ratio on the right side, prolonged the isovolumic relaxation time (IRT) and ejection time, shortened the isovolumic contraction time (ICT), and decreased left myocardial systolic peak velocities. Chemotherapy did not cause detectable changes. Conclusion Six of the eight drug groups caused detectable changes in fetal cardiac function.

We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the current state of knowledge on forests and freshwater fish in the tropics. The existing evidence is mostly concentrated in the neotropics. The majority of studies provided evidence that fish diversity was higher where there was more forest cover; this was related to the greater heterogeneity of resources in forested environments that could support a wider range of species. Studies quantifying fish abundance (or biomass) showed mixed relationships with forest cover, depending on species-specific habitat preferences. We identify the key challenges limiting our current understanding of the forest-fish nexus and provide recommendations for future research to address these knowledge gaps.

Treatment options, however, are limited due to reduced cardiopulmonary reserve and competing mortality risks. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of publications examining treatment planning considerations, clinical outcomes, and toxicity rates of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients who have previously undergone pneumonectomy. A systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines using PubMed and EMBASE from inception to July 2018. Articles were limited to those published in the English language. Non-review articles with patients who received exclusively lung SABR post-pneumonectomy were included. Two reviewers independently performed abstract and full-text review, with discrepancies settled by a third reviewer. Of the 215 articles identified by the initial search, 6 articles comprising 53 patients who received lung SABR post-pneumonectomy met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 68, and most patients were male (73.7%). The mean time to pneumonectomy was 6.5 years. The mean biologically effective dose was 115 Gy, and the most common dose fractionation schemes were 54 Gy in 3 fractions, 48 Gy in 4 fractions, and 50 Gy in 5 fractions. The mean follow-up was 25.4 months. The mean 1-year overall survival and 2-year local control rates were 80.6% and 89.4%. Grade 3 or higher toxicity was reported in 13.2% of patients. SABR appears to be a safe and feasible option for SPLCs in patients with prior pneumonectomy.

Despite the growing efforts to end this practice, the current trends of its decline are not enough to overcome the population's underlying growth. The aim of this research is to investigate the FGM/C household decision-making process and identify the main household decision-makers. A review of peer-reviewed articles was conducted by searching PubMed, JSTOR, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, EBSCO, and CINAHL Plus via systematic search using keywords. The found publications were screen using inclusion and exclusion criteria in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Electronic databases (PubMed [MEDLINE], Cochrane Library, EMBASE) were searched for corresponding references up to 31 May 2019. Possible outcomes were pulp exposure, pulpo-periodontal complications, or restorative failures. Three reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias using RoB 2. Meta-analyses for intention-to-treat and per-protocol scenarios were performed using Revman5. Of 1374 potentially eligible articles, ten relevant references corresponding to eight studies were included. Pooled results showed decreased risk of pulp exposure after SCR (OR: 0.10, 95% CI [0.04, 0.25]) or SWR (OR: 0.20, 95% CI [0.09, 0.44]), compared with CCR. There was a higher risk of composite restorative failure (OR: 2.61, 95% CI [1.05, 6.49]) using USPHS criteria, after SCR compared with CCR only in intention-to-treat analysis. Risk of clinical or radiographic failure of pulpo-periodontal complications was unchanged when compared with SCR and CCR or SWR. SCR and SWR may result in lower pulp exposure risk than CCR.

Hemodialysis is the major modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in 70% to 90% of patients, who require well-functioning vascular access for this procedure. The recommended access for hemodialysis is an arteriovenous fistula or a vascular graft. However, recourse to central venous catheters remains essential for patients whose chronic renal disease is diagnosed at the end stage or in whom an arteriovenous fistula cannot be created or maintained. Tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC) exposure can induce venous stenosis and occlusions and can result in superior vena cava syndrome and/or vascular access loss. Exhaustion of conventional vascular accesses is 1 of the greatest challenges that nephrologists and patients have to face. Several unconventional salvage-therapy routes for TDC placement in patients with exhausted upper body venous access have been reported in the literature.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The major factor driving PT implementation is the reduction in exit and integral dose compared to photon plans, which is expected to translate to reduced toxicity and improved quality of life. This study extends the findings from a recent systematic review by the current authors which concentrated on tumour outcomes for PT, to now examine toxicity as a separate focus. Together, these reviews provide a comprehensive collation of the evidence relating to PT outcomes in clinical practice. Three major databases were searched by two independent researchers, and evidence quality was classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. One hundred and seventy-nine studies were included. Most demonstrated acceptable and favourable toxicity results. Comparative evidence reported reduced morbidities and improvement in quality of life in head and neck, paediatrics, sarcomas, adult central nervous system, gastrointestinal, ocular and prostate cancers compared to photon radiotherapy. This suggestion for reduced morbidity must be counterbalanced by the overall low quality of evidence. A concerted effort in the design of appropriate comparative clinical trials is needed which takes into account integration of PT's pace of technological advancements, including evolving delivery techniques, image guidance availability and sophistication of planning algorithms.",2020,Menon_2022,0

32436472,A Systematic Review of Corporal Punishment in Schools: Global Prevalence and Correlates.,"Sasha-Lee Heekes, Chloe B Kruger, Soraya N Lester, Catherine L Ward","Despite global shifts toward prevention of school corporal punishment, the practice remains widespread. This systematic review focused on (a) prevalence, (b) associated mental health and behavioral factors, and (c) correlates that may be risk or protective factors. Studies included in this review were peer-reviewed, published in English between 1980 and July 2017, and quantitative in design. Fifty-three papers met the inclusion criteria. All were cross-sectional surveys, predominantly of moderate quality and conducted in the United States (US) and on the African continent. Results indicated that school corporal punishment is prevalent across the globe (including where bans are in place) and does not appear to be decreasing over time, although measurement differences preclude firm conclusions. It is associated with physical, academic, mental health, and behavioral problems for children. Boys, Black students (in the US), and students exposed to violence at home were most at risk of corporal punishment. It is unclear whether disability puts a student at risk. Schools with high rates of other disciplinary practices were more likely to use corporal punishment, while those who employed a mental health professional and trained staff in safety procedures were less likely to use corporal punishment. Teacher attitudes favoring corporal punishment, and their use of violence in other contexts, increased risk. Low socioeconomic status (of the student or the school environment) increased risk, while high levels of state social capital reduced risk. Future research must include areas where corporal punishment is banned and focus on developing effective interventions to prevent school corporal punishment.",2022,Menon_2022,0

This systematic review details the clinical manifestations, diagnostic methodology, and empirical anti-fungal therapy for this rare yeast. PubMed, LILACS, Scielo, and Web of Science databases were searched for articles about Pseudozyma spp. infections from inception to June 2019. Inclusion criteria were any published studies that included patients with Pseudozyma spp. infection. Infections were identified using criteria set forth by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and were further classified according to clinical, laboratory, or radiologic findings, microbiologic confirmation, and response to therapy. Eleven articles were included with 15 patients. Oncological and/or hematological disorders were the most reported risk factors. Nontraditional microbiological methods correctly identified Pseudozyma spp., whereas traditional methods failed to identify fungal genus. Species were identified by sequencing, and most demonstrated a higher minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fluconazole and echinocandins. MICs for itraconazole, voriconazole, and posaconazole varied by species. All isolates were susceptible to amphotericin B, which was the most used treatment. Pseudozyma spp. infections usually present with fever and are diagnosed by blood culture. Most species studied appeared to be resistant to fluconazole and echinocandin. Voriconazole, posaconazole, and amphotericin were effective in treating P. aphidis. However, more studies are needed to evaluate voriconazole and posaconazole in species other than P. aphidis.",2021,Menon_2022,0
32238052,Violence Exposure and Mental Health Among Resettled Refugees: A Systematic Review.,"Arielle A J Scoglio, Carmel Salhi","Refugee populations are often characterized by their high exposure to violence, which are tied to various challenges upon resettlement. This systematic review synthesizes the empirical literature related to violence exposure for refugees resettled in high-income countries and the impact of that exposure on mental health symptoms. The authors reviewed quantitative studies published from 2000 to 2018 and found 12 studies met criteria for inclusion. Studies were excluded if the study did not include a measured mental health outcome, if violence exposure was not measured and reported on distinctly from nonviolent exposures, if the sample did not include a refugee population, or if the relationship between violence exposure and mental health of refugees was not empirically examined. Overall, studies found that resettled refugee populations were more likely to have higher rates of violence exposure than comparison groups. This violence exposure was significantly related to higher mental health symptoms, including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and, most commonly reported, posttraumatic stress disorder. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in measurement of violence exposure, particularly in the use of author-created scales. The vast majority of included studies examined only exposure to violence prior to resettlement. The review shows significant evidence for the effect of violence prior to resettlement on mental health after resettlement and reveals a need for improved measurement and definitions of violence exposure at different time points for resettled refugee populations. Assessing current exposure to violence is an important step for effective intervention related to mental health dilemmas for refugee populations.",2021,Menon_2022,0

Among all available treatments, interventional percutaneous techniques have recently emerged as potential strategies for the management of oncologic patients with vertebral lesions. Minimally invasive image-guided therapies include ""ablative"" and ""consolidative"" ones. According to the number of metastases and the patient's performance status, ablative techniques can be performed with a curative or a palliative purpose since necrosis induced by critic changes of intralesional temperature determines both tumor debulking and destruction of pain receptors. On the other hand, consolidative treatments are based on the injection of polymethylmethacrylate cement to improve structural vertebral integrity and obtain pain alleviation and prevention of skeletal-related events. This article reviews the current recommendations supporting the role of interventional radiology in the management of vertebral metastases, focusing on the last updates in literature.",2020,Menon_2022,0

We searched for studies that examined individual, environmental, and political/cultural correlates of total and domain-specific SB (transport, occupation, leisure, and screen time) in Asian adults published from 2000 onwards in nine scientific databases. Two reviewers independently screened identified references. Following quality assessment of included studies, we performed narrative synthesis that considered differences based on SB measurements, regions, and population characteristics (PROSPERO: CRD42018095268). We identified 13 249 papers of which we included 49, from four regions and 12 countries. Researchers conducted cross-sectional analyses and most relied on SB self-report for SB measurement. Of the 118 correlates studied, the following associations were consistent: higher age, living in an urban area (East Asia), and lower mental health with higher total SB; higher education with higher total and occupational SB; higher income with higher leisure-time SB; higher transit density with higher total SB in older East Asians; and being an unmarried women with higher SB in the Middle East. We encourage more research in non-high-income countries across regions, further exploration of important but neglected correlates using longitudinal designs and qualitative research, and the use of objective instruments to collect SB data.",2020,Menon_2022,0

32501258,Preclinical models to optimize treatment of tuberculous meningitis - A systematic review.,"Carlijn H C Litjens, Rob E Aarnoutse, Lindsey H M Te Brake","Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most devastating form of TB, resulting in death or neurological disability in up to 50% of patients affected. Treatment is similar to that of pulmonary TB, despite poor cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of the cornerstone anti-TB drug rifampicin. Considering TBM pathology, it is critical that optimal drug concentrations are reached in the meninges, brain and/or the surrounding CSF. These type of data are difficult to collect in TBM patients. This review aims to identify and describe a preclinical model representative for human TBM which can provide the indispensable data needed for future pharmacological characterization and prioritization of new TBM regimens in the clinical setting. We reviewed existing literature on treatment of TBM in preclinical models: only eight articles, all animal studies, could be identified. None of the animal models completely recapitulated human disease and in most of the animal studies key pharmacokinetic data were missing, making the comparison with human exposure and CNS distribution, and the study of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships impossible. Another 18 articles were identified using other bacteria to induce meningitis with treatment including anti-TB drugs (predominantly rifampicin, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin). Of these articles the pharmacokinetics, i.e. plasma exposure and CSF:plasma ratios, of TB drugs in meningitis could be evaluated. Exposures (except for levofloxacin) agreed with human exposures and also most CSF:plasma ratios agreed with ratios in humans. Considering the lack of an ideal preclinical pharmacological TBM model, we suggest a combination of 1. basic physicochemical drug data combined with 2. in vitro pharmacokinetic and efficacy data, 3. an animal model with adequate pharmacokinetic sampling, microdialysis or imaging of drug distribution, all as a base for 4. physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling to predict response to TB drugs in treatment of TBM.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The information sources were the Web of Science and WanFang Data Knowledge Service Platform electronic databases. Only journal articles reporting quantitative empirical research were selected. The eligibility criteria included studies with (1) interventions of any indoor plant, excluding biofilters that combine power facilities and vegetation, (2) comparators included within the same experimental treatment or between different experimental treatments, (3) air quality effects objectively measured using any instrument, and (4) any study design. Both authors screened 95 journal articles and compiled information according to (1) intervention (plant species, foliage, or medium), (2) scientific family name of each plant, (3) study design (experiment, field experiment, or survey), (4) air quality (e.g., temperature, humidity, negative ions, radiation, and dust), (5) pollutants, (6) research environment, (7) ventilation (types and rates), (8) climate (lighting, temperature, and humidity), (9) exposure duration, (10) sampling frequency or period, and (11) number of replications.

Reflecting the building momentum of PT use worldwide, construction has recently commenced for The Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy and Research in Adelaide - the first PT centre in Australia. This systematic review aims to update the clinical evidence base for PT, both proton beam and carbon ion therapy. The purpose is to inform clinical decision-making for referral of patients to PT centres in Australia as they become operational and overseas in the interim. Three major databases were searched by two independent researchers, and evidence quality was classified according to the National Health and Medical Research Council evidence hierarchy. One hundred and thirty-six studies were included, two-thirds related to proton beam therapy alone. PT at the very least provides equivalent tumour outcomes compared to photon controls with the possibility of improved control in the case of carbon ion therapy. There is suggestion of reduced morbidities in a range of tumour sites, supporting the predictions from dosimetric modelling and the wide international acceptance of PT for specific indications based on this. Though promising, this needs to be counterbalanced by the overall low quality of evidence found, with 90% of studies of level IV (case series) evidence. Prospective comparative clinical trials, supplemented by database-derived outcome information, preferably conducted within international and national networks, are strongly recommended as PT is introduced into Australasia.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Cavitation bubbles occur when the US strength is high enough to generate rarefaction that exceeds the intermolecular attraction forces in the medium. Currently, US is widely used in meat industries to enhance procedures, such as meat tenderization, emulsification mass transfer, marination, freezing, homogenization, crystallization, drying, and microorganism inactivation. In addition, combining ultrasonic energy with a sanitizing agent has a synergistic effect on microbial reduction. When poultry meat is treated using US, the expected quality is often better than the traditional methods, such as sanitization and freezing. US can be considered as a novel green technology for tenderizing and decontamination of poultry meat since both Escherichia coli and Salmonella are sensible to US. US improves the physical and chemical properties of meat proteins and can lead to a decrease in the α-helix in intramuscular protease complex in addition to a reduction in the viscosity coefficients. Therefore, ultrasonic treatment can be applied to enhance the textural properties of chicken meat. US can also be used to improve the drying rate when used under vacuum, compared with other traditional techniques. This review focuses on the potential of US applications in the management of poultry industries as the demand for good quality meat proteins is increasing worldwide.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Patients and bolus-feeding operators (such as occupational therapist and speech language pathologist) may undergo multiple VFSS procedure, placing them at risk for more radiation exposure due to increased scan time. The present study investigated the dose-area product, effective dose of various protocols, and summarized dose reports from various studies of VFSS. The PubMed database searched for relevant publications reporting radiation dose in the VFSS procedure. 13 articles were selected to be reviewed. This systematic review involved 13 peer-reviewed articles that reported the specific dose of the VFSS procedure. The articles were categorized into three types: operator radiation dose, adult patient radiation dose, and pediatric radiation dose. The operator dose reports showed that the operators' scattering exposure, equivalent dose (across the whole body, eyes, and hands), and annual effective dose were significantly lower than the annual dose limit of 20 mSv. Both adult and pediatric patient dose reports showed that the effective dose, which was estimated from recorded dose-area product, was significantly lower than the annual background exposure of 2.4 mSv in various protocols. The present literature review suggested that the radiation dose of VFSS by modified barium swallowing is acceptable in both operators and patients.

32466498,Animal Models of Metabolic Epilepsy and Epilepsy Associated Metabolic Dysfunction: A Systematic Review.,"Uday Praful Kundap, Yam Nath Paudel, Mohd Farooq Shaikh","Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder affecting around 70 million people globally and is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Recent evidence indicates that dysfunction in metabolic processes can lead to the alteration of neuronal and network excitability, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. Developing a suitable animal model that can recapitulate all the clinical phenotypes of human metabolic epilepsy (ME) is crucial yet challenging. The specific environment of many symptoms as well as the primary state of the applicable neurobiology, genetics, and lack of valid biomarkers/diagnostic tests are the key factors that hinder the process of developing a suitable animal model. The present systematic review summarizes the current state of available animal models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorders. A systematic search was performed by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model. A range of electronic databases, including google scholar, Springer, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, were scanned between January 2000 and April 2020. Based on the selection criteria, 23 eligible articles were chosen and are discussed in the current review. Critical analysis of the selected literature delineated several available approaches that have been modeled into metabolic epilepsy and pointed out several drawbacks associated with the currently available models. The result describes available models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorder, such as mitochondrial respiration deficits, Lafora disease (LD) model-altered glycogen metabolism, causing epilepsy, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency, adiponectin responsive seizures, phospholipid dysfunction, glutaric aciduria, mitochondrial disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) α-subunit gene (PDHA1), pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE), BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), Kcna1 knock out (KO), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (lncRNA CASC2). Finally, the review highlights certain focus areas that may increase the possibilities of developing more suitable animal models and underscores the importance of the rationalization of animal models and evaluation methods for studying ME. The review also suggests the pressing need of developing precise robust animal models and evaluation methods for investigating ME.",2020,Menon_2022,0

The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the empirical literature examining the relationship between prenatal and postnatal low blood lead levels and executive function across childhood development. This review considers the unity and diversity model of executive functioning by assessing the domains of working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibition, attention, and unitary executive function separately. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesized in the review. The results suggest an inverse association between postnatal lead exposure and executive function processes across childhood. The inverse relationship between postnatal lead exposure and working memory and cognitive flexibility in middle childhood is most strongly represented. Additionally, a marginal inverse relationship between postnatal lead exposure and unitary executive functioning and attention in middle childhood is suggested. The evidence does not support a relationship between postnatal lead and inhibition in middle childhood. Although there is support for the inverse relationship between low level lead exposure and executive function, lack of repeated exposure and outcome measures limit firm conclusions. Furthermore, the long-term impact of lead exposure on executive function outcomes is relatively unknown given lack of studies on adolescent populations.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Failure to adequately prepare adolescents for transfer to adult care can lead to a decline in attendance to the adult clinic and an increase in the rate of non-adherence to medical treatment. The aim of this systematic review was to analyze studies exploring the experiences of adolescents, parents, and health professionals regarding the transition process of adolescents with CKD. Six databases were searched from inception to October 2018 for primary research articles. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria, with only one exploring the parents' experiences. The results indicated that up to 50% of adolescents did not feel prepared to transfer to adult care at the time of transfer, and the timing was not ideal for some adolescents. Health professionals acknowledged that adolescents and parents felt emotional attachment to the pediatric unit, which led to anxiety about transferring. Once in adult care, adolescents felt out of place among the older patients, overwhelmed by the environment and the lack of attention from health professionals. Initiatives that could support transfer include allowing adolescents to attend pediatric consultation independently and meeting with adult health professionals prior to transfer. This review found that the transition process must be more responsive to adolescents by tailoring the timing of transfer according to their ability to assume self-care responsibility. In addition, there is a need to focus on the parents and their role in the transition process.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Bright light treatment (BLT) is a promising non-pharmacological intervention; however, studies have yielded conflicting results. This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the effect of BLT in dementia, with a specific focus on how study characteristics might have affected the available results. The included studies were small and comprised time-limited interventions and follow-ups. Light values, adherence to treatment, and time of year were not consistently reported. Varying designs, methods, and population characteristics such as age, gender, dementia diagnosis, circadian phase, and baseline symptoms may have moderated the outcomes and affected review results. The use of crossover designs and too high illumination as placebo lights might have nullified positive effects of BLT. Because some studies had negative outcomes after ambient BLT with high amounts of short wavelengths, more modest light levels should be further investigated. Employing rigorous designs and detailed reporting of intervention characteristics, i.e., the illumination, correlated color temperature, timing, and duration of light utilized, are of utmost importance to establish the optimal treatment approach in this population.

Several treatment modalities have been investigated in an attempt to improve the management of MBM. This review aimed to evaluate the impact of current treatments for MBM on patient- and tumor-related outcomes, and to provide treatment recommendations for this patient population. A literature search in the databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane was conducted up to January 8, 2019. Original articles published since 2010 describing patient- and tumor-related outcomes of adult MBM patients treated with clearly defined systemic therapy were included. Information on basic trial demographics, treatment under investigation and outcomes (overall and progression-free survival, local and distant control and toxicity) were extracted. We identified 96 eligible articles, comprising 95 studies. A large variety of treatment options for MBM were investigated, either used alone or as combined modality therapy. Combined modality therapy was investigated in 71% of the studies and resulted in increased survival and better distant/local control than monotherapy, especially with targeted therapy or immunotherapy. However, neurotoxic side-effects also occurred more frequently. Timing appeared to be an important determinant, with the best results when radiotherapy was given before or during systemic therapy. Improved tumor control and prolonged survival can be achieved by combining radiotherapy with immunotherapy or targeted therapy. However, more randomized controlled trials or prospective studies are warranted to generate proper evidence that can be used to change the standard of care for patients with MBM.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Due to the varying radiosurgical response based on lesion location, tumor biology, and radiation dosage, we performed a pioneer attempt in doing a systematic review analyzing the treatment efficacy and safety profile of GKRS for PCFM based on current literature. A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses [PRISMA] guidelines. A thorough literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of science, and Cochrane data base; articles were selected systematically based on PRISMA protocol, reviewed completely, and relevant data was summarized and discussed. A total of 18 publications pertaining to GKRS for PCFM were included with a pooled sample size of 2131 patients. The median pre-GKRS tumor volume ranged from 2.28 to 10.5 cm [3]. Primary GKRS was administered in 61.1% of the pooled study cohorts, adjuvant treatment in 32.9%, and salvage therapy in 6.5% patients. Majority of the meningiomas were WHO grade 1 tumors (99.7%). The pooled mean marginal dose in the studies was 13.6 Gy (range 12-15.2 Gy) while the mean of maximum doses was 28.6 Gy (range 25-35 Gy). Most studies report an excellent radiosurgical outcome including the tumor control rate and the progression-free survival [PFS] of over 90%. The tumor control, PFS, and adverse radiation effect [ARE] rates in author's series were 92.3%, 91%, and 9.6%, respectively. The favorable radiosurgical outcome depends on multiple factors such as small tumor volume, absence of previous radiotherapy, tumor location, elderly patients, female gender, longer time from symptom onset, and decreasing maximal dose. GKRS as primary or adjuvant treatment modality needs to be considered as a promising management strategy for PCFM in selected patients in view of the growing evidence of high tumor control rate, improved neurological functions, and low incidence of ARE. The use of multiple isocenters, 3-D image planning, and limit GKRS treatment to tumors less than 3.5 cm help to avoid complications and achieve the best results. The treatment decisions in PCFM cases must be tailored and should consider the factors such as radiological profile, symptom severity, performance level, and patient preference for a good outcome.",2020,Menon_2022,0

A systemic review in PubMed and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was performed for articles on risk factors for IMD in children and adolescents published during a 20-year period (19/09/1998 to 19/09/2018). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established and applied. The data were meta-analyzed using random-effect model and the results were presented on forest plots separately for each risk factor. We identified 12,559 studies (duplicates removed). Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened and finally, six studies (five case-control and one cohort study) were included in qualitative synthesis, five in meta-analysis. The median age of meningococcal disease (MD) cases was 72.2 months (0-19 years). Household crowding, smoking exposure, close relationships, and recent respiratory tract infections conferred a more than twofold risk for IMD in exposed individuals compared to controls [overcrowded living OR 2.52 (95% CI 1.75-3.63), exposure to smoke OR 2.10 (95% CI 1.00-4.39), kissing OR 2.00 (95% CI: 1.13-3.51), and recent respiratory tract infection OR 3.13 (95% CI 2.02-4.86)]. Attendance of religious events was associated with a decreased risk [0.47 (95% CI, 0.28-0.79)].Conclusion: Our review highlights the importance of individual characteristics as risk factors for IMD in childhood and adolescence. Preventive policies may consider individual as well as social-environmental factors to target individuals at risk.What is Known:• Close relationships, household crowding, and recent respiratory tract infections are major risk factors for IMD.• Passive smoking is a major risk factor for IMD.What is New:• Intimate kissing, household crowding, and passive smoking were found to double the risk of IMD.• Recent respiratory tract infections almost tripled the risk for IMD.",2020,Menon_2022,0

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"M Graille, P Wild, J-J Sauvain, M Hemmendinger, I Guseva Canu, N B Hopf","Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production and elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with various inflammation-related human disease. ROS can oxidize lipids, which subsequently undergo fragmentation to produce F2-isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs). Eight-isoprostane is one of the most extensively studied F2-IsoPs and the most commonly used biomarker for the assessment of oxidative stress in human studies. This urinary biomarker is quantified using either chemical or immunological techniques. A ""physiological"" range for 8-isoprostanes is needed to use this biomarker as a measure of excess oxidative stress originating from occupational exposures. However, ranges reported in the literature are inconsistent. We designed a standardized protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess baseline values for 8-isoprostane concentrations in urine of healthy adults and identify determinants of their inter- and intra-individual variability. We searched PubMed from journal inception and up to April 2019, and screened articles for studies containing F2-IsoPs concentrations in urine for healthy adult participants. We grouped studies in three biomarker groups: ""8-isoprostane"", ""Isoprostanes"" ""15- F2t-Isoprostane"". We computed geometric mean (GM) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) as the basis for the meta-analysis. Of the initial 1849 articles retrieved, 63 studies were included and 107 subgroups within these study populations were identified. We stratified the subgroups analyzed with the chemical methods by body mass index (BMI) reported. We provide pooled GM values for urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations in healthy adults, separately for chemical and immunological analysis in this review. The interquartile range (IQR) in subgroups with a mean BMI below 25 measured using chemical methods was 0.18 to 0.40 μg/g creatinine. We show that there is a significant positive association between BMI and urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations. We recommend adjusting urinary 8-isoprostane concentrations in spot urine with creatinine, quantifying 8-isoprostane with chemical analytical methods, and reporting results as median and quartiles.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and explore the different types of digital technologies used in creating individualized, meaningful activities for people living with dementia. From 1414 articles identified from searches in four databases, 29 articles were included in the review. The inclusion criteria were the study used digital technology to deliver an individually tailored activity to participants with dementia, the process of individualization was described, and findings relating to the mental, physical, social, and/or emotional well-being of the participant were reported. Data extracted from the included studies included participant demographics, aims, methods, and outcomes. The following information on the technology was also extracted: purpose, type, training, facilitation, and the individualization process. A narrative synthesis of the results grouped the various technologies into four main purposes: reminiscence/memory support, behavior management, stimulating engagement, and conversation/communication support. A broad range of technologies were studied, with varying methods of evaluation implemented to assess their effect. Overall, the use of technology in creating individualized, meaningful activities seems to be promising in terms of improving behavior and promoting relationships with others. Furthermore, most studies in this review involved the person with dementia in the individualization process of the technology, indicating that research in this area is adopting a more co-creative and inclusive approach. However, sample sizes of the included studies were small, and there was a lack of standardized outcome measures. Future studies should aim to build a more concrete evidence base by improving the methodological quality of research in this area.

However, the true incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after these surgeries is unknown resulting in weak recommendations and lack of consensus regarding type and timing of prophylaxis in these patients. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine VTE incidence in addition to optimal type and timing of VTE prophylaxis. A detailed search was carried out on Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library databases through October 18, 2017, for studies that evaluated venous thromboembolic outcomes, type, and timing of prophylaxis administration among ASD surgery patients who were on VTE prophylaxis. The randomized study was assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane tool and the observational studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). The search yielded 1180 studies, and three articles published between 1996 and 2008 met the inclusion criteria. There were 583 surgeries performed on 537 patients with a mean age ranging from 45 to 52 years. Females dominated the study with percentages ranging from 60 to 94% in the different study populations.

Following this earthquake, rehabilitation was greatly required for survivors to enable them to achieve and maintain optimal independence; functioning; full physical, mental and social ability; inclusion; and participation in all aspects of life and environments. We conducted a systematic review based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to retrospectively identify, in five English databases/sources, the existing evidence about the Health-Related Rehabilitation (HRR) that was rendered to the survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake between 2008 and 2018. Only 11 studies out of 828 initial studies retrieved were included in our study and reported the survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake to have been aged between 10.5 and 55.7, and predominantly diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorders. Their HRR was mainly premised on physical and physiological therapies, as well as traditional Chinese medicine and digital technologies. Although all HRR interventions used were reported to be effective, none was identified as much more effective than the others in the post-earthquake era -which calls for more robust research to build upon our systematic review.",2020,Menon_2022,0

31337225,Impact of mother-infant interaction on development during the first year of life: A systematic review.,"Nelci Adriana Cicuto Ferreira Rocha, Fernanda Pereira Dos Santos Silva, Mariana Martins Dos Santos, Stacey C Dusing","The objectives of this project were to systematically review the impact of mother-infant interaction on the development of infants 12 months or younger and determine factors that mediate this relationship and early development. We systematically reviewed the literature and identified 21 papers which fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of the studies found significant association between mother-infant interaction and language, cognition, motor, and social development during the first year of life. Only seven studies assessed motor development and four studies found significant relationship between motor development and mother-infant interaction. Prematurity, infant age, multiples births, maternal anxiety, maternal opioid exposure, history of foster care, and criminal record were the only factors found to mediate the relationship between mother-infant interaction and social, cognitive, and language development. The quality of the interactions between a mother and infant can both positively and negatively influence cognitive, language, and social outcomes during the first year of life. Additional research is needed to determine the influence of mother-infant interaction on motor development. Future research is needed on the efficacy of interventions designed to alter mother-infant interaction with the ultimate goal of achieving positive developmental outcomes during the first year of life.",2020,Menon_2022,0
32577325,Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Children: Vulnerable or Spared? A Systematic Review.,"Hajra Saleem, Jawaria Rahman, Nida Aslam, Salikh Murtazaliev, Safeera Khan","The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected people from all cultures, religions, gender, and age groups around the world. In the last few months, several studies have been conducted on various aspects of COVID-19. Our goal was to see if the pediatric population is vulnerable to this infection. In this review, we conducted extensive research mainly by using the PubMed database. We used Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and associated keywords to engage in an extensive search focussing on COVID-19 in the pediatric population. We discovered that most of the studies were from China, and some of them were in the Chinese language. However, English translations of many of the studies were available. For accessing the relevant statistical data, we relied on the World Health Organization (WHO) resources and the official website of the Ontario Government (ontario.ca). Most of the studies showed that the virus has affected the pediatric population. However, we found some differences among these studies regarding the severity of symptoms in children affected by COVID-19. While a few studies stated that the virus has presented with milder symptoms in the pediatric population, some studies have presented data of children who have suffered life-threatening complications due to COVID-19. Although the data is limited, we have been able to conclude from the studies we reviewed that COVID-19 does indeed affect children the same way as any other age group. Moreover, children can act as carriers of the virus and can endanger the lives of other individuals. Besides, neonates and infants can easily acquire the infection from family members without having any exposure to the outside world. Hence, utmost care should be taken while handling this population. More trials and studies should be conducted to analyze the impact of early diagnosis of infection in children and its management.",2020,Menon_2022,0

32196925,Systematic Review and Weight of Evidence Are Integral to Ecological and Human Health Assessments: They Need an Integrated Framework.,"Glenn Suter, Jennifer Nichols, Emma Lavoie, Susan Cormier","Scientific assessments synthesize the various results of scientific research for policy and decision making. Synthesizing evidence in environmental assessments can involve either or both of 2 systems: systematic review (SR) and weight of evidence (WoE). Systematic review was developed to systematically assemble results of clinical trials to be combined by meta-analysis. Weight-of-evidence approaches have evolved from jurisprudence to make inferences from diverse bodies of evidence in various fields. Our objectives are to describe the similarities and differences between SR and WoE and to suggest how their best practices can be combined into a general framework that is applicable to human health and ecological assessments. Integrating SR and WoE is based on the recognition that 2 processes are required, assembling evidence and making an inference. Systematic review is characterized by methodical literature searching, screening, and data extraction, originally for meta-analysis but now for various inferential methods. Weight of evidence is characterized by systematically relating heterogeneous evidence to considerations appropriate to the inference and making the inference by weighing the evidence. Systematic review enables the unbiased assembly of evidence from literature, but methods for assembling other information must be considered as well. If only 1 type of quantitative study estimates the assessment endpoint, meta-analysis is appropriate for inference. Otherwise, the heterogeneous evidence must be weighed. A framework is presented that integrates best practices into a methodical assembly and weighing of evidence. A glossary of terms for the combined practice and a history of the origins of SR and WoE are provided in Supplemental Data. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2020;16:718-728. Published 2020.

The present manuscript describes the process currently being used by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program to evaluate animal toxicity studies, illustrated by application to the recent systematic reviews of two phthalates: diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The IRIS Program uses a domain-based approach that was developed after careful consideration of tools used by others to evaluate experimental animal studies in toxicology and pre-clinical research. Standard practice is to have studies evaluated by at least two independent reviewers for aspects related to reporting quality, risk of bias/internal validity (e.g., randomization, blinding at outcome assessment, methods used to expose animals and assess outcomes, etc.), and sensitivity to identify factors that may limit the ability of a study to detect a true effect. To promote consistency across raters, prompting considerations and example responses are provided to reviewers, and a pilot phase is conducted. The evaluation process is performed separately for each outcome reported in a study, as the utility of a study may vary for different outcomes. Input from subject matter experts is used to identify chemical- and outcome-specific considerations (e.g., lifestage of exposure and outcome assessment when considering reproductive effects) to guide judgments within particular evaluation domains. For each evaluation domain, reviewers reach a consensus on a rating of Good, Adequate, Deficient, or Critically Deficient. These individual domain ratings are then used to determine the overall confidence in the study (High Confidence, Medium Confidence, Low Confidence, or Deficient). Study evaluation results, including the justifications for reviewer judgements, are documented and made publicly available in EPA's version of Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC), a free and open source web-based software application.

Hence, in this study, we did a meta-analysis to explore the correlation between overexpression of these markers and some clinicopathological features and their influence on the survival of esophageal cancer patients. A search in PubMed and Web of Science (among all articles published up to January 16, 2018) was done using the following keywords: esophageal cancer, CD44, CD133, prominin-1, AC133. Suitable studies, that were selected based on the criteria listed in the Materials and Methods section, were chosen and hazard ratios with 95% conﬁdence intervals were estimated if available. Heterogeneity and sensitivity were also analyzed. Furthermore, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, Egger, and Begg tests. The study included 1346 patients from 13 related studies. The median rates of marker expressions by immunohistochemistry were 35.7% (30%-76.6%) from 9 studies for CD44 and 31.9% (21%-44.2%) from 5 studies for CD133. The accumulative 5-year overall survival rates of CD44-positive and CD133-positive were 1.59% (1.22-2.06) and 1.27% (0.93-1.73), respectively. Meta-analysis showed that CD44 expression had a significant correlation with 5-year overall survival. CD44 overexpression showed a correlation with some clinicopathological features such as lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, and recurrence of the disease, while it was not the case for coexpression of CD44 and CD133. In conclusion, CD44 overexpression was associated with a 5-year overall survival rate and thus this biomarker can be a suitable prognostic tool in esophageal cancer.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Four databases were used to select those articles that included information on the implementation of Teaching Games for Understanding in different educational stages. According to PRISMA guidelines and including the PICO strategy after the exclusion criteria, 12 articles were fully assessed based on eight criteria: (1) year and author; (2) country; (3) number of participants, educational level, and duration of implementation; (4) type of research; (5) curricular content; (6) purpose of the research; (7) most relevant results; and (8) learning environment. The results showed how research focuses on both primary and secondary education, primarily in short-term interventions. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed research is used almost equally, and dealt evenly with sports and games, leaving motor skills, physical abilities and body expression underrepresented.

An alternative approach to chemical treatments is to selectively enhance heritable honey bee traits of resistance or tolerance to the mite through breeding programs, or select for naturally surviving untreated colonies. We conducted a literature review of all studies documenting traits of A. mellifera populations either selectively bred or naturally selected for resistance and tolerance to mite parasitism. This allowed us to conduct an analysis of the diversity, distribution and importance of the traits in different honey bee populations that can survive V. destructor globally. In a second analysis, we investigated the genetic bases of these different phenotypes by comparing 'omics studies (genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics) of A. mellifera resistance and tolerance to the parasite. Altogether, this review provides a detailed overview of the current state of the research projects and breeding efforts against the most devastating parasite of A. mellifera. By highlighting the most promising traits of Varroa-surviving bees and our current knowledge on their genetic bases, this work will help direct future research efforts and selection programs to control this pest.

However, little is known about the effect of GDM on infant feeding, nutrition and growth, and whether these factors play a role in mediating these risks. We systematically reviewed evidence for the effect of GDM on infant feeding, nutrition and growth. We searched MEDLINE, Web-of-Science, Embase, CINAHL and CENTRAL for studies that reported outcomes in infants <2 years who were and were not exposed to GDM. Studies of pre-gestational diabetes were excluded. Meta-analysis was performed for three epochs (1–6, 7–12, 13–24 months), using inverse-variance, fixed-effects methods. Primary outcomes were energy intake (kJ) and BMI (kg/m2). Twenty-five studies and 308 455 infants were included. Infants exposed to GDM, compared with those not exposed, had similar BMI at age 1–6 months (standardised mean difference (SMD) = 0·01, 95 % CI −0·04, 0·06; P = 0·69) and 7–12 months (SMD = 0·04, 95 % CI −0·01, 0·10; P = 0·09), reduced length at 1–6 and 7–12 months, increased whole-body fat at 1–6 months, higher rates of formula supplementation in hospital, shorter duration of breast-feeding and decreased rates of continued breast-feeding at 12 months. Breast milk of women with GDM had lower protein content. There was no association between GDM and infant weight and skinfold thickness.

Therefore, the present study was conducted to assess the mean mercury level in hair and breast milk (BM) of Iranian lactating mothers (ILMs) through meta-analysis technique. We conducted a systematic literature search in online electronic databases included main domestic databases (SID, Magiran, Iran medex, Medlib and ISC) and international databases (Embase, Scopus and PubMed) for studies published between 2000 up 2018. Each process of research and evaluation of articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria is done by two researchers, individually. From10 studies entered to meta-analysis process including 556 ILM, the mean hair mercury level (HML) and mean milk mercury level (MML) was estimated to be 0.15 μg/g (95 CI: 0.11-0.19, I2: 47.6%, P: 0.028) and 0.51 μg/l (95 CI: 0.28-0.74, I2: 1.9%, P: 0.421), respectively. In this meta-analysis, the mean HML and mean MML were estimated to be lower than the standard of World Health Organization (WHO).

We included 39 articles for meta-analysis. The results showed that low-dose exposure to arsenic (≤ 10 μmol/L) could promote the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylation-protein kinase B (p-AKT). High-dose arsenic exposure (> 10 μmol/L) promoted the expression of PI3K, HIF-1α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and p38MAPK (P38). Acute arsenic exposure (< 24 h) promoted the expression of PI3K, HIF-1α, and VEGF. Chronic arsenic exposure (≥ 24 h) promoted the expression of PI3K, p-AKT, and P38. Moreover, for normal tissue-derived cells, arsenic could induce the increased expression of PI3K, p-AKT, HIF-1α, and VEGF. For tumor tissue-derived cells, arsenic could induce the expression of PI3K, p-AKT, and P38. We found that arsenic exposure could activate the PI3K/AKT pathway, further induce the high expression of HIF-1α, and then upregulate the levels of miRNA-21 and VEGF, promote the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and ultimately lead to malignant cell proliferation. Our findings indicated that arsenic could increase the expression of HIF-1α by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and eventually induce malignant cell proliferation.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Rashes, pruritus, and more rarely, reactions resembling Stevens-Johnsons syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) may occur secondary to checkpoint inhibitors. To characterize existing literature on these reports, we queried the PubMed/MEDLINE database for cases of SJS or TEN associated with checkpoint inhibitors. We identified 18 cases of SJS or TEN-like reactions to checkpoint inhibitors in the literature. There were 12 cases of SJS-like rashes with median time to onset of 5.6 weeks (average of 8.9 weeks), of which five were delayed to week 8 or later from checkpoint inhibitor initiation. The five TEN-like reactions had a median time to onset of 4 weeks (average of 5.38 weeks), of which two were delayed to week 6 or later. SJS/TEN-like reactions to nivolumab (seven cases) had median onset time of 3 weeks, whereas five cases secondary to pembrolizumab had median onset time of 11 weeks. Seven cases in this study described prodromal rashes, which varied from localized papular rashes to generalized morbilliform rashes, prior to evolution into SJS or TEN-like patterns. SJS-like patterns generally improved well on systemic treatment/supportive care and no cases of death were identified, but mortality occurred in three of five patients with TEN-like reactions. Dermatologists should consider the possibility for unique features of SJS/TEN in response to checkpoint inhibitors. Additional studies will be necessary to further characterize SJS/TEN-like eruptions on checkpoint inhibitors and determine the optimal management of these cases.",2020,Menon_2022,0

These patients face a unique challenge due to the complexity of GVHD and the toxicity of treatments received. GVHD has significant impact on quality of life (QOL), but this is not routinely evaluated formally. Despite the availability of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to assess QOL, there is currently no consensus regarding the optimal PROMs that should be used to evaluate the impact of GVHD. We undertook a systematic review to determine the current evidence for the use of PROMs in assessment of QOL, symptom burden, and disease severity of patients with GVHD. A comprehensive systematic review based on the COSMIN guidelines was conducted to identify studies using PROMs (including those for QOL and symptom burden) in acute and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) patients. The following databases were searched: OVID Medline, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, PROQOLID, ProQuest, PsychINFO, and Social Sciences Citation Index from inception to May 2018. Hand searches updated the search to December 2018. Articles were screened by 2 independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third independent reviewer. Included articles were critically appraised using the COSMIN Risk of Bias tool, and relevant data on measurement properties for the included PROMs were extracted from within the target population. A total of 4545 articles were identified, and 64 articles reporting on 27 PROMs were included in this review. PROMs were separated into 5 groups; generic patient-reported measures (n = 7), cancer-specific measures (n = 4), bone marrow transplant-specific measures (n = 2), cGVHD-specific measures (n = 4), and dimension-specific measures (n = 10). Three PROMs (Human Activity Profile, Lee Symptom Scale, National Institutes of Health Eleven Point Scale) had evidence to support strong reliability (including internal consistency), responsiveness, and aspects of validity within the cGVHD population. Only 5 included PROMs were used in patients with acute GVHD. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the use of 27 included PROMs in the context of GVHD. The choice of the most optimal PROM depends on the clinical or research context of use. Future research should comprehensively validate these tools in the GVHD population, including the testing and possible development of a PROM for use in acute GVHD, which remains a current critical gap in the existing literature.",2020,Menon_2022,0

To date, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has spread to over 200 countries, leading to over 1.6 million cases and over 99,000 deaths. Given that there is neither a vaccine nor proven treatment for COVID-19, there is currently an urgent need for effective pharmacotherapy. To address the need for an effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 during the worldwide pandemic, this systematic review of intravenous (IV) remdesivir was performed. Remdesivir, an anti-viral prodrug originally developed to treat Ebola virus disease, has shown broad spectrum activity against the Coronavirus family. A recent case report reported improvement of clinical symptoms with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19. After conducting a systematic search of 18 clinical trial registries and three large scientific databases, we identified 86 potentially eligible items. Following removal of duplicates (n = 21), eligible studies were reviewed independently by two authors. After the first round of screening, inter-rater agreement was 98.5% (κ = 0.925). After the second round of full-text screening, inter-rater agreement was 100%. A total of seven ongoing and recruiting clinical trials of remdesivir (100-200 milligrams, intravenous [IV]) were included. We identified the following primary outcomes: patients discharged (n = 2); time to clinical status improvement (n = 2); improved O2 saturation (n = 2); body temperature normalization (n = 2); and clinical status (n = 1). Secondary outcomes in all identified studies included documentation of adverse events. Phase 3 trials are expected to be completed between April 2020-2023. Therefore, despite supportive data from in vitro and in vivo studies, the clinical effectiveness of IV remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 and potential side effects remain incompletely defined in the human population.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Visual and informational front-of-pack cues constitute salient elements of the environment that may influence what and how much someone eats. Considering their overwhelming presence on packaging of non-core foods, front-of-pack cues may contribute to the growing rates of overweight and obesity in children and adults. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the evidence concerning the impact of front-of-pack cues on choices and eating behaviors. Four electronic databases were searched for experimental studies (2009-present). This resulted in the inclusion of 57 studies (in 43 articles). We identified studies on children (3-12 years) and adults (≥ 18 years), but no studies on adolescents (12-18 years). The results suggest that children and adults are susceptible to packaging cues, with most evidence supporting the impact of visual cues. More specifically, children more often choose products with a licensed endorser and eat more from packages portraying the product with an exaggerated portion size. Adults' eating behaviors are influenced by a range of other visual cues, mainly, package size and shape, and less so by informational cues such as labels.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Recent research has suggested that antibiotic-induced disruption of the microbiota may impact ICI efficacy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the impact of antibiotic use on the survival of patients diagnosed with NSCLC and treated with ICI. We systematically searched Medline, the Cochrane Library, and major oncology conferences proceedings. Eligible studies mentioned hazard ratio or Kaplan-Meier curves for progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) based on antibiotic exposure before or during ICI treatment. We identified 23 eligible studies. The impact of antibiotics was then evaluated in 2208 patients for PFS and 5560 for OS.

32472404,Laparoscopic versus open complete mesocolic excision: a systematic review by updated meta-analysis.,"Paschalis Gavriilidis, R Justin Davies, Antonio Biondi, James Wheeler, Mario Testini, Giulio Carcano, Salomone Di Saverio","Recent evidence has proven the non-inferiority of laparoscopic complete mesocolic excision (LCME) to open complete mesocolic excision (OCME) with regard to feasibility and oncological safety. However, the differences in survival benefits between the 2 procedures have not been assessed. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether or not one procedure was superior to the other using updated meta-analysis. A systematic search for relevant literature was performed in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library and Google scholar databases. This meta-analysis included retrospective studies and one randomised controlled trial comparing LCME to OSCME. LCME to OCME was evaluated using updated meta-analysis. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the methodologic quality of the studies. Fixed- and random-effects models were used, and survival outcomes were assessed using the inverse variance hazard ratio (HR) method. Operative time was significantly shorter in the OCME cohort than in the LCME cohort. Blood loss, wound infections, time to flatus, time to oral feeding, and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter in the LCME cohort than in the OCME cohort. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survivals were better in the LCME cohort than in the OCME cohort ([HR = 0.37 (0.22, 0.65); p = 0.004], [HR = 0.48 (0.31, 0.74); p = 0.008], and [HR = 0.64 (0.45, 0.93); p = 0.02], respectively). No difference in the 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) between the 2 procedures was observed ([HR = 0.68 (0.44, 1.03); p = 0.07]). In contrast, the LCME cohort had better 3- and 5-year DFS rates than those of the OCME cohort ([HR = 0.63 (0.42, 0.97), p = 0.03] and [HR = 0.68 (0.56, 0.83), p = 0.001], respectively). The results of the present study must be interpreted cautiously because the included studies were retrospective from single centres. Therefore, selection, institutional and national bias may have influenced the results. LCME is associated with the faster postoperative recovery and some better potential survival benefits than OCME.",2020,Menon_2022,0

However, there has not been a systematic review of this important association in the existing literature. This study aims to fill this gap. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published from 1 January 2019 onwards that examined the association between bike lane access and weight-related behaviours and outcomes among children aged <18 years. A total of 21 studies were included in this systematic review. Among them, most of the studies showed that bike lane access was significantly associated with children and adolescents' physical activity (PA), whereas only two studies showed a negative association. Meta-analysis also supported these findings and showed that bike lane access was significantly associated with children and adolescents' PA (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.81). Additionally, we reviewed how bike lane characteristics and microenvironment variables such as children and adolescents' choice of bicycle travel mode, the degree of separation of cycle path, cycle path unevenness, and street maintenance were associated with adolescents' preferences and intention to cycle. This systematic review and meta-analysis strongly suggests that bike lane access is associated with children and adolescents' PA. Nonetheless, it was difficult to draw a conclusion on the association between bike lane access and weight-related outcomes.",2021,Menon_2022,0

A search was conducted in six life science databases to identify clinical trials carried out on permanent teeth with a carious pulp exposure and a recall interval of at least six months. Twenty-seven trials of low to moderate risk of bias (RoB-2 and ROBINS-I) were included. Data was extracted and analyzed regarding study characteristics and methods used for pulp wound lavage. The agent used for pulp wound lavage was specified in all included trials. Most of the identified trials (23/27) randomized the pulp capping material. Many (14/27) reported the use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); ten used only saline or water. One trial was identified that compared pulp wound lavage with 2.5% (NaOCl) to saline, another compared 5% glutaraldehyde to water, both in immature molar pulpotomies. Both studies were underpowered.

A Systematic Review with Meta-Analyses.,"Anna Iliadi, Despina Koletsi, Theodore Eliades, George Eliades","Composite dust generation is most likely a continuous and daily procedure in dental practice settings. The aim of this systematic review was to identify, compile and evaluate existing evidence on interventions and composite material properties related to the production of aerosolized dust during routine dental procedures. Seven electronic databases were searched, with no limits, supplemented by a manual search, on 27 April 2020 for published and unpublished research. Eligibility criteria comprised of studies of any design, describing composite dust production related to the implementation of any procedure in dental practice. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment was undertaken independently either in duplicate, or confirmed by a second reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses of standardized mean differences (SMD) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were employed where applicable. A total of 375 articles were initially identified, resulting in 13 articles being included in the qualitative synthesis, of which 5 contributed to meta-analyses overall. Risk of bias recordings ranged between low and high, pertaining to unclear/raising some concerns, in most cases. All types of composites, irrespective of the filler particles, released significant amounts of nano-sized particles after being ground, with potentially disruptive respiratory effects. Evidence supported increased % distribution of particles < 100 nm for nanocomposite Filtek Supreme XTE compared to both conventional hybrid Z100MP (SMD: 1.96, 95% CI: 0.85, 3.07; p-value; 0.001) and nano- hybrid Tetric EvoCeram (SMD: 1.62, 95% CI: 0.56, 2.68; p-value: 0.003). For cytotoxicity considerations of generated aerosolized particles, both nanocomposites Filtek Supreme XTE and nanohybrid GradiO revealed negative effects on bronchial epithelial cell viability, as represented by % formazan reduction at 330-400 μg/ml for 24 hours, with no recorded differences between them (SMD: 0.19; 95% CI: -0.17, 0.55; p-value: 0.30). Effective and more rigorous management of dental procedures potentially liable to the generation of considerable amounts of aerosolized composite dust should be prioritized in contemporary dental practice. In essence, protective measures for the clinician and the practices' personnel should also be systematically promoted and additional interventions may be considered in view of the existing evidence.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Amongst healthcare workers, nurses are known to struggle with burnout symptoms the most, carrying serious consequences for patients, other healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations. Evidence has suggested that burnout symptoms in nurses is high across specialties and countries, but no meta-analysis have been performed to investigate burnout symptoms prevalence in nurses globally. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine burnout symptoms prevalence in nurses worldwide using 8 academic research databases. Risk of bias, heterogeneity and subgroup analyses were further conducted in the meta-analysis. 113 studies were included for systematic review and 61 studies for the meta-analysis, consisting 45,539 nurses worldwide in 49 countries across multiple specialties. An overall pooled-prevalence of burnout symptoms among global nurses was 11.23%. Significant differences were noted between geographical regions, specialties and type of burnout measurement used. Sub-Saharan African region had the highest burnout symptoms prevalence rate while Europe and Central Asia region had the lowest. Paediatric nurses had the highest burnout symptoms prevalence rates among all specialties while Geriatric care nurses had the lowest. This study is the first study to synthesize published studies and to estimate pooled-prevalence of burnout symptoms among nurses globally.

Novel therapies like brentuximab vedotin (BV) have yielded promising results, yet their optimal use in older cHL remains unclear. We performed a systematic review to assess outcomes and toxicity associated with frontline regimens in older cHL. We screened 196 references involving chemotherapy without BV and 662 references containing BV and included 9 studies (12 arms) without BV and 6 studies (7 arms) with BV. Progression-free survival (PFS) ranged from 47 to 84% at 2 years in BV-containing arms and 42-79% at 5 years in non-BV containing trials. Pulmonary toxicity was more common in arms receiving >2 cycles of bleomycin, whereas peripheral neuropathy was associated with cumulative BV dose. This review summarizes available treatment outcomes in newly diagnosed older cHL patients and may aid clinicians in decision-making regarding available frontline approaches.Key PointsThis systematic review suggests that >2 cycles of bleomycin is associated with excess pulmonary toxicity in cHL patients older than 60 years of age.Peripheral neuropathy was more frequent in patients receiving BV-containing regimens and was associated with cumulative BV dose.BV-containing regimens are associated with high response rates in advanced-stage patients, but follow-up is limited.",2020,Menon_2022,0

PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched from inception to December 2019. Studies performing pre-cooling interventions in non-acclimatized highly-trained athletes (>55 mL/kg/min of maximal oxygen consumption) under heat conditions (≥30 °C) were included. The searched reported 26 articles. Pre-cooling techniques can be external (exposure to ice water, cold packs, or cooling clothes), internal (intake of cold water or ice), or mixed. Cooling prior to exercise concluded increases in distance covered (1.5-13.1%), mean power output (0.9-6.9%), time to exhaustion (19-31.9%), work (0.1-8.5%), and mean peak torque (10.4-22.6%), as well as reductions in completion time (0.6-6.5%). Mixed strategies followed by cold water immersion seem to be the most effective techniques, being directly related with the duration of cooling and showing the major effects in prolonged exercise protocols. The present review showed that pre-cooling methods are an effective strategy to increase sports performance in hot environments. This improvement is associated with the body surface exposed and its sensibility, as well as the time of application, obtaining the best results in prolonged physical exercise protocols.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Because no clinical trial has been conducted to examine the surgical treatment of MBC, we performed a systematic review comparing the survival of patients with MBC who had undergone breast conserving surgery (BCS) and those who had undergone mastectomy and evaluated the patients' radiotherapy compliance after BCS. We performed a systematic search of electronic databases to find MBC cohort studies that had reported ≥ 1 survival outcome (disease-free survival [DFS], disease-specific survival [DSS], or overall survival [OS]) stratified by surgical treatment (BCS and/or mastectomy) and/or radiotherapy compliance with BCS. A total of 1 prospective and 9 retrospective cohort studies were included, with the number of patients ranging from 7 to 6039. Of the BCS patients, compliance with postoperative radiotherapy was low (range, 27%-46%), with the exception of 1 single-institution prospective study that reported 86% compliance (6 of 7 patients). The pooled estimate for all patients with MBC was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78%-88%) for 5-year DSS and 66% (95% CI, 63%-70%) for 5-year OS. Most studies reported no differences in DFS, DSS, or OS for BCS and mastectomy. BCS is a reasonable treatment approach for MBC because it was associated with oncologic outcomes similar to those with mastectomy. However, the low rates of radiotherapy compliance among male patients who underwent BCS is concerning and highlights the importance of shared decision-making with patients with MBC when selecting a surgical treatment strategy.",2020,Menon_2022,0

This systematic review of systematic reviews collates all the evidence across professional groups to provide guidance to policy makers for implementing healthcare professional delivery of behavior change interventions. Eight electronic databases were searched for systematic reviews reporting patient-facing healthcare professionals' (e.g., general practitioners, nurses) barriers and enablers to delivering behavior change interventions (diet, physical activity, alcohol reduction, smoking cessation, and weight management). A narrative synthesis was conducted. Thirty-six systematic reviews were included. Four themes emerged as both barriers and enablers: (1) perceptions of the knowledge or skills needed to support behavior change with patients, (2) perceptions of the healthcare professional role, (3) beliefs about resources and support needed, and (4) healthcare professionals' own health behavior. There were four cross-disciplinary barriers: (1) perceived lack of time, (2) perceived lack of prioritization of health behavior change, (3) negative attitudes towards patients and perceptions of patient risk, and (4) perceptions of patient motivation. The three enablers were as follows: (1) training, (2) context, and (3) attitudes towards delivering interventions. To enhance healthcare professionals' delivery of behavior change interventions, policy makers should (a) address perceptions about patient need for interventions, (b) support diverse professional groups to identify opportunities to deliver interventions, and (c) encourage professionals to focus on prevention and management of health conditions.",2020,Menon_2022,0

31697863,Barriers and Facilitators to Help-Seeking for Individuals With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Review.,"Jennifer R Smith, Aklile Workneh, Sanni Yaya","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) brings with it diagnostic symptoms that can be debilitating and persist for years. Left untreated, PTSD can have far-reaching and damaging consequences for the individual, families, communities, and society at large. Although early detection and intervention are recognized as key to the effective treatment of PTSD, many individuals who suffer from PTSD do not seek essential health services. The aim of the present study was to identify the barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for individuals with PTSD, based on existing literature. A systematic review, modeled on the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for systematic reviews, examined studies cited in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PILOTS published from January 1980 to January 2019. Eligible studies measured barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for adults with PTSD. Two reviewers independently screened citations, and double data extraction was exercised. Of 2,391 potentially relevant citations, 21 studies, published between 1989 and 2018 and based in six countries, were included. Seventeen studies focused on military as a target population. We identified 10 principal barrier and facilitator themes: trauma-related; treatment; therapist or provider; knowledge; access; health care system; sociocultural environment; values, beliefs, and priorities; past experiences; and medical care needs and illness burden. In identifying prominent barriers and facilitators to help-seeking for individuals with PTSD, this review highlights opportunities to inform policies and programs that promote PTSD knowledge and recognition, reduce public and personal stigma, improve access and quality of care, and encourage support for patients and families living with PTSD.",2020,Menon_2022,0

It has been associated with multiple long-term deleterious outcomes including revictimization in adulthood. This systematic review of 25 studies synthesizes research examining possible risk and protective factors that might explain the established link between CSA and future victimizations. Specific risk factors identified included co-occurring maltreatment in the home, risky sexual behavior (particularly in adolescence), post-traumatic stress disorder, emotion dysregulation, and other maladaptive coping strategies. Only one protective factor was identified: perceived parental care. The review also revealed considerable variability in definitions and measurement of both CSA and adult victimization, particularly in terms of how researchers conceptualized age. Many of the studies were limited in generalizability by including only college-age women. These findings have clinical and research implications. Public health interventions working to prevent revictimization among CSA survivors can utilize these findings when designing programs. For researchers, the results highlight the need for standardized definitions of both CSA and revictimization, for well-validated and consistent measurement, and for inclusion of additional population groups in future research.",2021,Menon_2022,0

31907379,Epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: a systematic review of empirical human findings.,"Lukasz Smigielski, Vinita Jagannath, Wulf Rössler, Susanne Walitza, Edna Grünblatt","Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are highly debilitating psychiatric conditions that lack a clear etiology and exhibit polygenic inheritance underlain by pleiotropic genes. The prevailing explanation points to the interplay between predisposing genes and environmental exposure. Accumulated evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation of the genome may mediate dynamic gene-environment interactions at the molecular level by modulating the expression of psychiatric phenotypes through transcription factors. This systematic review summarizes the current knowledge linking schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders to epigenetics, based on PubMed and Web of Science database searches conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Three groups of mechanisms in case-control studies  of human tissue (i.e., postmortem brain and bio-fluids) were considered: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding miRNAs. From the initial pool of 3,204 records, 152 studies met our inclusion criteria (11,815/11,528, 233/219, and 2,091/1,827 cases/controls for each group, respectively). Many of the findings revealed associations with epigenetic modulations of genes regulating neurotransmission, neurodevelopment, and immune function, as well as differential miRNA expression (e.g., upregulated miR-34a, miR-7, and miR-181b). Overall, actual evidence moderately supports an association between epigenetics and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. However, heterogeneous results and cross-tissue extrapolations call for future work. Integrating epigenetics into systems biology may critically enhance research on psychosis and thus our understanding of the disorder. This may have implications for psychiatry in risk stratification, early recognition, diagnostics, precision medicine, and other interventional approaches targeting epigenetic fingerprints.",2020,Menon_2022,0

32236839,Efficiency of tetrofosmin versus sestamibi achieved through shorter injection-to-imaging times: A systematic review of the literature.,"W Lane Duvall, James Case, Justin Lundbye, Manuel Cerqueira","Based on superior image quality, more accurate gated images, and lower radiation exposure to patients, Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) based tracers are preferred over Thallium-201 for SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging. The two Tc-99m tracers, sestamibi and tetrofosmin, have many similar characteristics but there are differences in blood and liver clearance rates, as well as the recommended time after injection for imaging to achieve optimal image quality. Because published peer-reviewed studies examining optimal times between injection and imaging are limited, it can be difficult to identify evidence-based opportunities to optimize imaging protocols. Using systematic literature review methods, this study was designed to identify and consolidate the available evidence on the use of sestamibi compared to tetrofosmin for variable injection to imaging times in regard to test efficiency, including test length and re-scan rates, and image quality, including overall quality and cardiac to extra-cardiac ratios. The composite of this data shows that earlier imaging with tetrofosmin is equivalent to later imaging with sestamibi when assessing subjective image quality or when quantifying heart-to-extra-cardiac ratios. Image quality and heart-to-extra-cardiac ratios comparing early versus later imaging with tetrofosmin were comparable if not equivalent to each other. The equivalency of the imaging quality occurs with 15 minutes (on average) earlier imaging compared to sestamibi and 30 minutes compared to standard time tetrofosmin. The subjective findings of equivalent image quality are also shown with objective measurements of heart-to-extra-cardiac ratios. In this review, the significantly shorter injection-to-acquisition times with tetrofosmin compared to sestamibi resulted in better efficiency and less waiting times for patients; in addition, significantly higher re-scan rates with sestamibi compared to tetrofosmin due to hepatic activity contributed to better throughput with tetrofosmin.",2021,Menon_2022,0

The term ""smart city"" has been used synonymously with other terms, such as ""digital city"", ""sustainable city"", and ""information city"", even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use ""smart cities"" as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies.",2020,Menon_2022,0

In this Bayesian network meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the best therapeutic option in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AEs). PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and the American Society of Clinical Oncology databases were searched from inception until 20 August 2018. We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for RFS and OS and relative odds ratios (ORs) for AEs and surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities were calculated. A number of 872 records were identified, and six were finally included in the meta-analysis. A total of 4244 patients in six studies were randomized. The following therapies were considered in the selected studies: combined dabrafenib and trametinib, vemurafenib, nivolumab, ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. Nivolumab demonstrated the highest probability (75.1%) of being the best in term of RFS, followed by dabrafenib+trametinib, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab and vemurafenib; however, OS was not estimable.

Such management often needs to be delivered in crisis situations to patients who are at risk of harm to themselves or others. This paper summarizes the available evidence on the effectiveness and safety of chemical restraint from 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3788 patients. The RCTs were of moderate to high quality and were conducted in pre-hospital, hospital emergency department, or ward settings. Drugs used in chemical restraint included olanzapine, haloperidol, droperidol, risperidol, flunitrazepam, midazolam, promethazine, ziprasidone, sodium valproate, or lorazepam. There was limited comparability between studies in drug choice, combination, dose, method of administration (oral, intramuscular, or intravenous drip), or timing of repeat administrations. There were 31 outcome measures, which were inconsistently reported. They included subjective measures of behaviours, direct measures of treatment effect (time to calm; time to sleep), indirect measures of agitation (staff or patient injuries, duration of agitative or aggressive episodes, subsequent violent episodes), and adverse events. The most common were time to calm and adverse events. There was little clarity about the superiority of any chemical method of managing behaviours of concern exhibited by patients in Emergency Departments or acute mental health settings.

Sixty-nine studies were included in the quantitative synthesis, and separate meta-analyses were conducted for the outcomes self-reported craving and objective food intake. Results show small to medium positive effects across specific craving interventions on both outcomes. Effect sizes were partly moderated by intervention type. The most effective intervention regarding food intake was in sensu cue exposure. For subjective craving, the most robust evidence was found for beneficial effects of cognitive regulation strategies (ie, reappraisal, suppression, and distraction). Results further indicate that training inhibitory control through behavioral inhibition might be more effective than approach-avoidance training when considering its effect on subjective craving and food intake. People with external eating habits, overeating, or loss-of-control eating might benefit from these types of specific craving interventions. Future research should focus on long-term effects, transferability, and effectiveness in clinical samples.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Cancer research was directly affected by the emerging of this disease. According to some Chinese studies, cancer patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 complications. This observation led many oncologists to change their daily practice in cancer care, without solid evidence and recommendations. Moreover, the COVID-19 manifestations as well as its diagnosis are particular in this special population. In this review paper we expose the challenges of cancer management in the era of SARS-CoV-2, the epidemiological, clinical, pathological and radiological characteristics of the disease in cancer patients and its outcomes on this population.

Scientific data reviewed herein showed that extracts prepared from medicinal and edible mushrooms and their individual metabolites presented antiinflammatory, antioxidant, photoprotective, antimicrobial, anti-tyrosinase, anti-elastase, and anticollagenase activities. These metabolites can be utilised as ingredients to suppress the severity of Inflammatory Skin Diseases, offer photoprotection to the skin, and correct Hyperpigmentation. However, studies regarding the molecular mechanism behind the mentioned bioactivities are still lacking. Challenges associated with the use of mushroom extracts and their associated metabolites as cosmeceutical and nutricosmetic ingredients include several steps from the fruiting bodies to the final product: extraction optimization, estimation of the efficacy and safety claims, the use of micro and nanocarriers to allow for controlled release and the pros and cons associated with the use of extracts vs individual compounds. This systematic review highlights that mushrooms contain diverse biomolecules that can be sustainably used in the development of nutricosmetic and cosmeceutical formulations. Reports regarding stability, compatibility, and safety assessment, but also toxicological studies are still needed to be considered.

Various countries have developed toolkits to determine High Conservation Value Areas (HCVAs) according to their needs and conservation strategies but there is no global agreement on them. The present study attempts to review research papers and assessment reports from 1999 until 2018 on approaches and methodologies used for HCVs all over the world and provide a review into HCV research systematically, with due consideration to the linkages between Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services and Socio-Economic-Cultural values. We analyzed and examined the trends which are emerging and gaps present in HCV assessments evident from literature reviewed by experts, including the spatial spread of research, the evolving use and content of the concept, and consultation with stakeholders. A total, 80 articles were taken from Scopus and various reputed journals and reports using keywords like HCV and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) to specifically focus on the application and evolution of the concept designed by FSC. The study was done in the hope to help in analyzing different HCV components as a conservation planning tool and guide new research in methodologies to fill the current gaps and enhance HCV assessments at different levels of application.

Recent studies have shown extensive ac4C modifications in human and yeast mRNAs. ac4C helps to correctly read codons during translation and improves translation efficiency and the stability of mRNA. At present, the research of ac4C involves a variety of detection methods. The formation of ac4C is closely related to N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) and its helpers, such as putative tRNA acetyltransferase (TAN1) for tRNA ac4C and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) for rRNA ac4C. Also, ac4C is associated with the development, progression, and prognosis of a variety of human diseases. Here, we summarize the history of ac4C research and the detection technologies of ac4C. We then summarized the role and mechanism of ac4C in gene-expression regulation and demonstrated the relevance of ac4C to a variety of human diseases, especially cancer.

New preclinical studies on group A streptococcus (GAS) exposure investigate how to disentangle the influences of immune activation to induce long-term neurobehavioral effects associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia or autism. The present systematic review collects neurobehavioral evidence regarding the use of GAS exposure in animal models to study the vulnerability to different neuropsychiatric disorders, improving our understanding of its possible causes and consequences, and compares its contribution with other preclinical models of immune activation in a variety of paradigms. Specifically, we reviewed the effects of postnatal GAS exposure, in comparison with post- and prenatal exposure to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), on the long-term effects concerning psychomotor, cognition and socioemotional outcomes in rodents. GAS exposure in animal models has revealed different behavioral alterations such as reduced locomotion and motor coordination, a deficit in sensorimotor gating, learning, working memory, altered social behavior, and increased anxiety and stereotyped behavior. Most of the results found are in accordance with other immune activation models -LPS and Poly I:C-, with some discrepancies. The systematic review of the literature supports the preclinical model of GAS exposure as a valid model for studying the neurobehavioral consequences of streptococcal infections. Future studies on streptococcal infection could contribute increasing our knowledge on preventive actions or treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.",2020,Menon_2022,0

Broad use of this term does not imply endorsement by FDA) of prescription drugs that occurs in the context of a clinical encounter. This research offers an important perspective on the broader goal of incorporating patient and prescriber voices in decision-making. Outcomes included patient information seeking, medication adherence, patient requests for DTCA-promoted prescription drugs, prescribing behaviors, and perceptions of the patient-prescriber relationship and interactions. We searched PubMed and other databases from 1982-2017 and identified 38 studies meeting our study criteria. Of these, 24 studies used patient-reported outcomes and 18 used prescriber-reported outcomes (four used both). Studies suggested some potential benefits of exposure to DTCA, including patients' enhanced information-seeking, increased patient requests for appropriate prescriptions (when addressing potential underuse) and patients' perceptions of higher-quality interactions with prescribers. Most prescribers perceived a neutral influence on the quality of their clinical interactions with patients regarding DTCA. Harms included patients receiving prescriptions for drugs that were not appropriate for them or that the patients did not need, and the potential for DTCA to interfere with medication adherence in some populations, such as those with mental illness. The potential benefits of DTCA on the patient-provider encounter must be balanced with the potential for harms.",2020,Menon_2022,0
30909822,The Relevance of Cognitive Behavioral Models of Post-Traumatic Stress Following Child Maltreatment: A Systematic Review.,"Hannah Wiseman, Catherine Hamilton-Giachritsis, Rachel M Hiller","While it is known that young people exposed to maltreatment or abuse are at elevated risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), much of our current knowledge of mechanisms that link trauma to childhood PTSD is based on single-incident, often noninterpersonal, trauma. Theoretical models highlight psychological processes of appraisals, memory, and coping as important for the development of PTSD. The aim of this review was to synthesize the literature on the role of these key psychological processes in relation to PTSD in maltreated children and teens. Studies were included if they (1) identified a sample of maltreated individuals, ≤18 years old; (2) measured (a) trauma memory, (b) appraisals, or (c) post-trauma cognitive or behavioral responses; and (3) measured PTSD symptoms. The systematic search of three electronic databases (American Psychological Association PsychNet, PubMed, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress) resulted in the inclusion of 36 papers, which described 31 studies and 33 unique samples. The review found cognitive behavioral models of PTSD appeared appropriate for understanding outcomes following maltreatment, but further research is needed on all processes, particularly trauma memory. Overall, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of how psychological processes link maltreatment to PTSD. There is limited evidence concerning how maltreatment-related characteristics (e.g., chronicity, duration, and type of abuse) influence psychological processes and in turn affect outcomes. This review recommends further research in this area and suggests that, at the very least, comprehensive assessment should be conducted with all young people reporting maltreatment to identify appraisals and coping strategies that will potentially impact on their ongoing adjustment.",2021,Menon_2022,0

This paper offers an overview of recent ETA research prototypes that employ smartphones for assisted orientation and navigation in indoor and outdoor spaces by providing additional information about the surrounding objects. Scientific achievements in the field were systematically reviewed using PRISMA methodology. Comparative meta-analysis showed how various smartphone-based ETA prototypes could assist with better orientation, navigation, and wayfinding in indoor and outdoor environments. The analysis found limited interest among researchers in combining haptic interfaces and computer vision capabilities in smartphone-based ETAs for the blind, few attempts to employ novel state-of-the-art computer vision methods based on deep neural networks, and no evaluations of existing off-the-shelf navigation solutions. These results were contrasted with findings from a survey of blind expert users on their problems in navigating in indoor and outdoor environments.

Despite the fact that NAs have a favourable safety profile, undesired adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment of CHB. Given the eminent number of patients currently receiving NAs, even a small risk of any of these toxicities can represent a major medical issue. The main objective of this review was to analyse information available on AEs associated with the use of NAs in published studies. We choose the following MesH terms for this systematic review: chronic hepatitis B, side effects and treatment. All articles published from 1 January 1990 up to 19 February 2018 in MEDLINE of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and LILACS databases were searched. A total of 120 articles were selected for analysis, comprising 6419 patients treated with lamivudine (LAM), 5947 with entecavir (ETV), 3566 with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), 3096 with telbivudine (LdT), 1178 with adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) and 876 with tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). The most common AEs in all NAs assessed were abdominal pain/discomfort, nasopharyngitis/upper respiratory tract infections, fatigue, and headache. TAF displays the highest density of AEs per patient treated among NAs (1.14 AE/treated patient). In conclusion, treatment of CHB with NAs is safe, with a low incidence of AEs. Despite the general understanding TAF being safer than TDF, the number of patients treated with TAF still is too small in comparison to other NAs to consolidate an accurate safety profile.

This article presents a systematic literature review of current safety training provision for migrant construction workers. In the interests of rigor, we draw on the learning, training transfer, and training effectiveness literatures, exploring not only the extent to which training brings about the intended outcomes, in terms of enhanced safety behaviors, and reduced accidents and injuries, but also the factors that influence learning and transfer of training back to the working environment. The literature search revealed only 18 peer-reviewed articles have been published since 2000, which is particularly surprising, given the disproportionate accident and fatality rates for migrant workers. Consequently, we propose a research agenda to enhance safety training for low skilled, migrant and native construction workers, drawing on cognitive and social constructivist instructional design models, which view training as a dynamic process involving active participation of trainees. We advocate the importance of attending to the situational context in which workers are embedded, including labor market conditions, social relations, and cultural differences.

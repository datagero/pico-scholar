16644224,"A prospective, randomised study comparing two techniques of autologous chondrocyte implantation for osteochondral defects in the knee: Periosteum covered versus type I/III collagen covered.","C R Gooding, W Bartlett, G Bentley, J A Skinner, R Carrington, A Flanagan",The results for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in the treatment of full thickness chondral defects in the knee are encouraging. At present two techniques have been described to retain the chondrocyte suspension within the defect. The first involves using a periosteal cover (ACI-P) and the second involves using a type I/III collagen membrane (ACI-C). To the authors knowledge there are no comparative studies of these two techniques in the current literature. We have therefore undertaken such a study to establish if there is a difference between the 2 techniques based on a clinical and arthroscopic assessment.,2006,Jeyaraman_2020,1

Since a lack of OCA bone integration can be a cause of treatment failure, methods for speeding and enhancing OCA bone integration to mitigate this potential complication are highly desirable. This study sought to determine and compare the potential of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMC) and leukoreduced platelet rich plasma (PRP) to repopulate the osseous portion of an OCA with cells and deliver osteogenic proteins. It was hypothesized that BMC would have significantly higher colony forming units (CFUs)/mL and seed the osseous portion of OCA with more cells than PRP. Finally, we hypothesized that the media of BMC and PRP treated OCAs would have significantly higher concentrations of osteogenic proteins compared with negative control OCAs.

Consequently, many studies have been performed to identify suitable prevention and treatment interventions. In recent years, both arthroscopic microfracture (AM) and stem cell therapy have been used clinically to treat OA. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of AM in the presence and absence of a stromal vascular fraction (SVF) injection in the management of patients with OA. Thirty patients with grade 2 or 3 (Lawrence scale) OA of the knee participated in this study. Placebo group patients (n = 15) received AM alone; treatment group patients (n = 15) received AM and an adipose tissue-derived SVF injection. The SVF was suspended in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) before injection into the joint. Patient groups were monitored and scored with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), Lysholm, Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), and modified Outerbridge classifications before treatment and at 6, 12, and 18 months post-treatment. Bone marrow edema was also assessed at these time points. Patients were evaluated for knee activity (joint motion amplitude) and adverse effects relating to surgery and stem cell injection. Treatment efficacy was significantly different between placebo and treatment groups. All treatment group patients had significantly reduced pain and WOMAC scores, and increased Lysholm and VAS scores compared with the placebo group. These findings suggest that the SVF/PRP injection efficiently improved OA for 18 months after treatment. This study will be continuously monitored for additional 24 months.

Evidence for the variety of surgical treatments available is inconclusive. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with symptomatic cartilage defects treated with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI or microfracture (MF). Included patients were >or= 18 and <or= 50 years of age with symptomatic, post-traumatic, single, isolated chondral defects (4-10 cm2) and were randomised to receive MACI or MF. Patients were followed up 8-12, 22-26 and 50-54 weeks post-operatively for efficacy and safety evaluation. Outcome measures were the Tegner, Lysholm and ICRS scores. Sixty patients were included in a randomised study (40 MACI, 20 MF). The difference between baseline and 24 months post-operatively for both treatment groups was significant for the Lysholm, Tegner, patient ICRS and surgeon ICRS scores (all P < 0.0001). However, MACI was significantly more effective over time (24 months versus baseline) than MF according to the Lysholm (P = 0.005), Tegner (P = 0.04), ICRS patient (P = 0.03) and ICRS surgeon (P = 0.02) scores. There were no safety issues related to MACI or MF during the study. MACI is superior to MF in the treatment of articular defects over 2 years. MACI and MF are complementary procedures, depending on the size of the defect and symptom recurrence. The MACI technique represents a significant advance over both first and second generation chondrocyte-based cartilage repair techniques for surgeons, patients, health care institutions and payers in terms of reproducibility, safety, intraoperative time, surgical simplicity and reduced invasiveness.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,1

Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 57 athletes with a mean age of 24.3 years and with a symptomatic lesion of the articular cartilage in the knee were randomized to undergo either OAT or MF procedure. There were 28 athletes in OAT group and 29 in MF group. Patients were evaluated using a modified Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scores, MRI and clinical assessment after 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the surgery. According to the modified HSS and ICRS scores, functional and objective assessment showed that 96% had excellent or good results after OAT compared with 52% after MF procedure (P<0.001).

In the first experiment, the DN gel was implanted in a surgically created defect in the femoral trochlea of rabbit knee joints and the left knee was used as the control. Evaluations using a confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that the DN gel did not affect the surface microstructure (surface roughness, the number of small pits) of the counterface cartilage in vivo at 4 and 12 weeks. The histology also showed that the DN gel hadno pathological damage on the cartilage matrices and cells at 4 weeks. However, two of the five DN gel-implanted knees showed mild irregularity on the counterface cartilage surface at 12 weeks. In the second experiment, the friction property between the normal and the artificial cartilage was determined using a joint simulator apparatus. The ex vivo mean friction coefficient of the DN gel to normal cartilage was 0.029, while that of the normal-to-normal cartilage articulation was 0.188. The coefficient of the DN gel-to-normal cartilage articulation was significantly lower than that of the normal-to-normal cartilage articulation (p < 0.0001). This study suggested that the PAMPS/PDMAAm DN gel has very low friction coefficient on normal cartilage and has no significant detrimental effects on counterface cartilage in vivo, and can be a promising material to develop the artificial cartilage.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0
17441197,Regional multilineage differentiation potential of meniscal fibrochondrocytes: implications for meniscus repair.,"Robert L Mauck, Gabriel J Martinez-Diaz, Xiaoning Yuan, Rocky S Tuan","The knee menisci are wedge-shaped semilunar fibrocartilaginous structures that reside between the femur and tibia and function to transmit and distribute load. These structures have characteristics of both fibrous and cartilaginous tissues. The cartilage-like inner region and the fibrous vascularized outer region each has a distinct extracellular matrix, and resident meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs) with distinct morphologies dependent on their location. Damage to the meniscus is common, and disruption of tissue structure and function result in erosion of the underlying articular cartilage. It has been observed that damage in the vascular periphery undergoes spontaneous repair, whereas damage of the inner region does not heal. While vascularity of the peripheral region plays a role in healing, recent findings have also suggested that local cellular composition influences local healing capacity. This study examined the variation in multipotential characteristics of cell populations isolated from different regions of the bovine meniscus. MFCs were isolated from the outer (vascular), inner (avascular), and horn (mixed) regions and induced toward chondrogenic, adipogenic, and osteogenic lineages. The results of this study suggest that MFCs from all regions of the meniscus possess a multilineage differentiation capability, particularly toward chondrogenesis and adipogenesis. MFCs from the outer region were most plastic, differentiating along all three mesenchymal lineages. These findings may underlie the experimental observation of improved integration of meniscus grafts from the outer zone and may have implications for developing strategies of cell-based meniscus repair.",2007,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In this study, we developed a 3D printing-based biomimetic and composite tissue-engineered meniscus scaffold consisting of polycaprolactone (PCL)/silk fibroin (SF) with extraordinary biomechanical properties and biocompatibility. We hypothesized that the meticulously tailored composite scaffold could enhance meniscus regeneration and cartilage protection. ",2020,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Meniscus tissue engineering solution is one option to improve outcomes and relieve pain. In an attempt to fabricate knee meniscus grafts three layered wedge shaped silk meniscal scaffold system was engineered to mimic native meniscus architecture. The scaffolds were seeded with human fibroblasts (outside) and chondrocytes (inside) in a spatial separated mode similar to native tissue, in order to generate meniscus-like tissue in vitro. In chondrogenic culture in the presence of TGF-b3, cell-seeded constructs increased in cellularity and extracellular matrix (ECM) content. Histology and Immunohistochemistry confirmed maintenance of chondrocytic phenotype with higher levels of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) and collagen types I and II. Improved scaffold mechanical properties along with ECM alignment with time in culture suggest this multiporous silk construct as a useful micro-patterned template for directed tissue growth with respect to form and function of meniscus-like tissue.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0

28966382,Role of High Tibial Osteotomy in Cartilage Regeneration - Is Correction of Malalignment Mandatory for Success?,"Matthew Dhanaraj Thambiah, Melvin K L Tan, James H P Hui","Malalignment of the knee can cause debilitating symptoms such as pain, resulting in a decline in function and mobility. Surgical options that exist to address this problem include realignment osteotomies and joint replacements. Realignment osteotomies are the more appropriate options in certain patient populations, especially with regard to age and level of activity. Since a high tibial osteotomy (HTO) was first used to manage malalignment of the knee and osteoarthritis, different techniques involving the use of specialized implants have been developed and further refined to good effect. There has also since been much research into the field of cartilage restoration techniques, both as a standalone treatment option and as an adjunct to a realignment osteotomy. This review attempts to detail the origin and the evolution of HTO, particularly in regard to combining this tried and tested procedure with adjunct cartilage restoration techniques, and the overall patient outcomes. A literature search on PubMed was performed, and articles pertaining to the outcomes of the use of an HTO and cartilage restoration techniques were reviewed. The literature in this field indicates good outcomes in terms of objective measurements of cartilage regeneration (such as arthroscopic visualization and magnetic resonance imaging evaluation) and subjective patient outcome scoring systems (such as the International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm scores) with a realignment osteotomy alone, and studies have shown that patient outcomes can be further improved with the use of a cartilage restoration procedure as an adjunct.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

We also evaluated the cartilage repair response to six smaller microdrill holes compared with two larger holes. Bilateral knee trochlear cartilage defects were created in n=8 skeletally mature rabbits, drilled with six proximal 0.5 mm and two distal 0.9 mm holes, then covered with in situ-solidified IIa-implants (treated) or with IIa-alone (control). After 6.5 months of repair, cartilage repair tissues were analyzed by histological scoring and histomorphometry for hyaline matrix characteristics and osseous integration. Subchondral repair bone was analyzed by 3D microcomputed tomography and compared to acute defects (n=6) and intact trochlea (n=8). Implant-treated cartilage repair tissues had higher structural integrity through the entire defect (p=0.02), twofold higher percent staining for glycosaminoglycan (p=0.0004), and ~24% more collagen type II staining over the smaller drill holes (p=0.008) compared with controls. Otherwise, hole diameter had no specific effect on cartilage repair. The subchondral bone plate was partially restored in treated and control defects but less dense than intact trochlea, with evidence of incomplete regeneration of the calcified cartilage layer. More residual drill holes (p=0.054) were detected in control versus treated defects, and control defects with more than 40% residual holes presented abnormally thicker trabeculae compared with treated defects. Low osteoclast numbers after 6.5 months repair suggested that bone was no longer remodeling. The subchondral bone plate surrounding the defects exhibited a significant thickening compared with age-matched intact trochlea. These data suggest that debridement and drilling can lead to long-term subchondral bone changes outside the cartilage defect. Compared with drilled controls, chitosan implants solidified with thrombin elicited a more hyaline and structurally integrated osteochondral unit, features needed for long-term durability.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Previous studies promote the fabrication of grafts consisting of a viable cell-seeded hydrogel integrated atop a porous, bone-like metal. Advantages of the manufacturing process have led to the evaluation of porous titanium as the bone-like base material. Here, porous titanium was shown to support the growth of cartilage to produce native levels of Young's modulus, using a clinically relevant cell source. Mechanical and biochemical properties were similar or higher for the osteochondral constructs compared to chondral-only controls. Further investigation into the mechanical influence of the base on the composite material suggests that underlying pores may decrease interstitial fluid pressurization and applied strains, which may be overcome by alterations to the base structure.

However, the injectable carriers available at present have limitations, and are not used clinically for cartilage regeneration. Here, we report nanofibrous hollow microspheres self-assembled from star-shaped biodegradable polymers as an injectable cell carrier. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres, integrating the extracellular-matrix-mimicking architecture with a highly porous injectable form, were shown to efficiently accommodate cells and enhance cartilage regeneration, compared with control microspheres. The nanofibrous hollow microspheres also supported a significantly larger amount of, and higher-quality, cartilage regeneration than the chondrocytes-alone group in an ectopic implantation model. In a critical-size rabbit osteochondral defect-repair model, the nanofibrous hollow microspheres/chondrocytes group achieved substantially better cartilage repair than the chondrocytes-alone group that simulates the clinically available autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure.

The hypothesis was that they support chondrogenesis. A biodegradable, highly porous polycaprolactone-grate was produced by solid freeform fabrication. The polycaprolactone support was coated with a chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet produced by electrospinning. Transforming growth factor-β3-induced chondrogenesis was followed using the following markers: sex determining region Y/-box 9, runt-related transcription factor 2 and collagen II and X in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology and immunostaining. A polycaprolactone-grate and an optimized chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibre sheet supported cellular aggregation, chondrogenesis and matrix formation. In tissue engineering constructs, the sheets were seeded first with mesenchymal stem cells and then piled up according to the lasagne principle. The advantages of such a construct are (1) the cells do not need to migrate to the tissue engineering construct and therefore pore size and interconnectivity problems are omitted and (2) the cell-tight nanofibre sheet and collagen-fibre network mimic a cell culture platform for mesenchymal stem cells/chondrocytes (preventing escape) and hinders in-growth of fibroblasts and fibrous scarring (preventing capture).

After osteochondral grafts were performed, the animals were treated with PEMFs for 6 h/day or sham-treated. Six animals were sacrificed at 1 month. Fourteen animals were treated for 2 months and sacrificed at 6 months. At 1 month, the osteogenic activity at the transplant-host subchondral bone interface was increased in PEMF-treated animals compared to controls. Articular cartilage was healthy in controls and stimulated animals. At 6 months, complete resorption was observed in four control grafts only. Cyst-like resorption areas were more frequent within the graft of sham-treated animals versus PEMF-treated. The average volume of the cysts was not significantly different between the two groups; nevertheless, analysis of the variance of the volumes demonstrated a significant difference. The histological score showed no significant differences between controls and stimulated animals, but the percentage of surface covered by fibrous tissue was higher in the control group than in the stimulated one. Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration in the synovial fluid was significantly lower, and transforming growth factor-beta1 was significantly higher, in PEMF-treated animals compared to controls. One month after osteochondral graft implantation, we observed larger bone formation in PEMF-treated grafts which favors early graft stabilization. In the long term, PEMF exposure limited the bone resorption in subchondral bone; furthermore, the cytokine profile in the synovial fluid was indicative of a more favorable articular environment for the graft.",2008,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promising results in OA, but their mechanism of action is not fully understood. We hypothesize that MSCs polarize macrophages, which are strongly associated with joint inflammation to more homeostatic sub-types. We tracked ferumoxytol (Feraheme™, iron oxide nanoparticle)-labeled murine MSCs (Fe-MSCs) in murine OA joints, and quantified changes to joint inflammation and fibrosis. 10-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 5/group) were induced to undergo osteoarthritis by destabilization of medical meniscus (DMM) or sham surgery. 3 weeks post-surgery, mice were injected intra-articularly with either fluorescent dye-(DiR) labeled or DiR-Fe-MSC or saline to yield 4 groups (n = 5 per group for each timepoint [1, 2 and 4weeks]). 4 weeks after injection, mice were imaged by MRI, and scored for i) OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) to determine cartilage damage; ii) immunohistochemical changes in iNOS, CD206, F4/80 and Prussian Blue/Sca-1 to detect pro-inflammatory, homeostatic and total macrophages and ferumoxytol -labeled MSCs respectively, and iii) Masson's Trichrome to detect changes in fibrosis. Ferumoxytol-labeled MSCs persisted at greater levels in DMM vs. SHAM-knee joints. We observed no difference in OARSI scores between MSC and vehicle groups. Sca-1 and Prussian Blue co-staining confirmed the ferumoxytol label resides in MSCs, although some ferumoxytol label was detected in proximity to MSCs in macrophages, likely due to phagocytosis of apoptotic MSCs, increasing functionality of these macrophages through MSC efferocytosis. MRI hypertintensity scores related to fluid edema decreased in MSC-treated vs. control animals. For the first time, we show that MSC-treated mice had increased ratios of %CD206+: %F4/80+ (homeostatic macrophages) (p<0.05), and decreased ratios of %iNOS+: %F4/80+ macrophages (p<0.01), supporting our hypothesis that MSCs may modulate synovial inflammation.",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Their fate and distribution were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and macroscopic and histologic postmortem examination. Osteoarthritis was induced in 12 sheep by bilateral meniscectomy. After 6 weeks, one knee joint received 10 × 10(6) SPIO-labeled MSCs (Molday Ion Rhodamine B). Contralateral knees received a control injection of a) PBS, b) SPIO in PBS, c) 10 × 10(6) nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs in PBS, or d) no injection. MR images were acquired immediately after injection and 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks thereafter using a 0.5-T unit and a T2* sequence. Signal intensity of synovial fluid and synovial lining was assessed semiquantitatively using a scoring system. Viable SPIO-labeled MSCs produced a strong hypointense signal in the synovial fluid immediately after injection, but normal signal intensity of the synovial fluid was observed 1 week later. Synovial lining maintained its hypointensity throughout the study period. Nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs induced hypointense signals of the synovial fluid; synovial lining appeared weak and inconsistently hypointense in the following weeks. Pure SPIO produced a strong hyperintense signal in the synovial fluid at the time of injection only. Histologically, in all knee joints receiving viable SPIO-labeled MSCs, SPIO particles were detected (Prussian blue) within the synovial lining, dorsal fat pad, and neomeniscus tissue, but not in osteochondral samples. Few SPIO particles were detected in joints injected with nonvital SPIO-labeled MSCs. Immunohistologically, no increased cell death (TUNEL) was observed in the area of detected SPIO particles, but we did observe potential chondrogenic cell differentiation (Safranin O or S100β). We conclude that viable SPIO-labeled MSCs remain detectable within the joint for 12 weeks and attach themselves to some but not all diseased joint structures.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Osteochondral (OC) tissue compromises soft cartilage over hard subchondral bone with a calcified cartilage interface between these two tissues. Osteochondral defects can be caused by numerous factors such as trauma and arthritis. Tissue engineering offers the possibility of a sustainable and effective treatment against osteochondral defects, where the damaged tissue is replaced with a long-lasting bio-manufactured replacement tissue. This review evaluates both bi-phasic and multi-phasic scaffold-based approaches of osteochondral tissue regeneration, highlighting the importance of having an interface layer between the bone and cartilage layer.

We synthesized a PVA-poly(acrylic acid) (PAAc) hydrogel formulation and determined its ability to function as a treatment option for condylar osteochondral (OC) defects in a New Zealand white rabbit (NZWR) model for 12 weeks and 24 weeks. In addition to hydrogel OC implants, tensile bar-shaped hydrogels were also implanted subcutaneously to evaluate changes in mechanical properties as a function of in vivo duration. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the water content measured in the OC hydrogel implant that was harvested after 12 weeks and 24 weeks, and non-implanted controls. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the break stress, strain at break or modulus of the tensile bars either between groups. Histological analysis of the OC defect, synovial capsule and fibrous tissue around the tensile bars determined hydrogel biocompatibility. Twelve-week hydrogels were found to be in situ flush with the articular cartilage; meniscal tissue demonstrated an intact surface. Twenty-four week hydrogels protruded from the defect site due to lack of integration with subchondral tissue, causing fibrillation to the meniscal surface. Condylar micro-CT scans ruled out osteolysis and bone cysts of the subchondral bone, and no PVA-PAAc hydrogel contents were found in the synovial fluid. The PVA-PAAc hydrogel was determined to be fully biocompatible, maintained its properties over time, and performed well at the 12 week time point. Physical fixation of the PVA-PAAc hydrogel to the subchondral bone is required to ensure long-term performance of hydrogel plugs for OC defect repair.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The avascular nature of cartilage and the altered chondrocyte phenotype characteristic of OA severely limit the capacity for in vivo tissue regeneration. Cell- and tissue-based repair has the potential to revolutionize treatment of OA, but those approaches have exhibited limited clinical success to date. In this study, we test the hypothesis that bovine and human chondrocytes in a collagen type I scaffold will form hyaline cartilage ex vivo with immunohistochemical, biochemical, and magnetic resonance (MR) endpoints similar to the original native cartilage. Chondrocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-week-old calf knee cartilage or from cartilage obtained from human total knee arthroplasties, suspended in 2.7 mg/mL collagen I, and plated as 300 microL spot cultures with 5 x 10(6) each. Medium formulations were varied, including the amount of serum, the presence or absence of ascorbate, and treatments with cytokines. Bovine chondrocytes generated metachromatic territorial and interstitial matrix and accumulated type II collagen over time. Type VI collagen was confined primarily to the pericellular region. The ex vivo-formed bovine cartilage contained more chondroitin sulfate per dry weight than native cartilage. Human chondrocytes remained viable and generated metachromatic territorial matrix, but were unable to support interstitial matrix accumulation. MR analysis of ex vivo-formed bovine cartilage revealed evidence of progressively maturing matrix, but MR-derived indices of tissue quality did not reach those of native cartilage. We conclude that the collagen-spot culture model supports formation and maturation of three-dimensional hyaline cartilage from active bovine chondrocytes. Future studies will focus on determining the capacity of human chondrocytes to show comparable tissue formation.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Current treatment methods such as microfracture result in less resilient fibrocartilage with eventual failure; autografting can cause donor site morbidity and poor integration. To overcome drawbacks in treatment, tissue engineers can design cell-instructive biomimetic scaffolds using biocompatible materials as alternate therapies for osteochondral defects. Nanofibrous poly (l-lactic acid) (PLLA) scaffolds of uniform, spherical, interconnected and well-defined pore sizes that are fabricated using a thermally-induced phase separation and sugar porogen template method create an extracellular matrix-like environment which facilitates cell adhesion and proliferation. Herein we report that chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification of rabbit and human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) can be controlled by scaffold pore architecture, particularly pore size. Small-pore scaffolds support enhanced chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and cartilage formation in vivo compared to large-pore scaffolds. Endochondral ossification is prevented in scaffolds with very small pore sizes; pore interconnectivity is critical to promote capillary ingrowth for mature bone formation. These results provide a novel strategy to control tissue regenerative processes by tunable architecture of macroporous nanofibrous scaffolds. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Progress in understanding the relationship between cell fate and architectural features of tissue engineering scaffolds is critical for engineering physiologically functional tissues. Sugar porogen template scaffolds have uniform, spherical, highly interconnected macropores. Tunable pore-size guides the fate of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) towards chondrogenesis and endochondral ossification, and is a critical design parameter to mediate neotissue vascularization. Preventing vascularization favors a chondrogenic cell fate while allowing vascularization results in endochondral ossification and mineralized bone formation. These results provide a novel strategy to control tissue regenerative processes by tunable architecture of macroporous nanofibrous scaffolds.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS Porous PLGA scaffolds were prepared in a bilayered manner to reflect the structure of chondral and subchondral bone. Bone defects, measuring 4 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness, were created in both knee joints in 18 healthy New Zealand white rabbits, aged between 120-180 days old. Rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: rabbits with bone defects implanted with bilayer PLGA scaffolds (PLGA group) (N=6); or with bilayer PLGA and autologous PRP (PLGA/PRP group) (N=6); and the untreated group (control group) (N=6). The gross morphology, histology, and immunohistochemistry for the expression of collagen type II and aggrecan were observed at 12 weeks after surgery and compared using a scoring system. Micro-computed tomography (CT) imaging and relative expression of specific genes were also assessed. RESULTS The platelet concentrations in the PRP samples were found to be 4.9 times greater than that of whole blood samples. The total score on gross appearance and histology was greatest in the PLGA/PRP group, as was the expression of collagen II and aggrecan of the neo-tissue. Micro-CT imaging showed that more subchondral bone was formed in the PLGA/PRP group.

Herein, we evaluate the delivery of xenogeneic human MSCs (hMSCs) within an injectable ELR-based hydrogel carrier for osteochondral regeneration in rabbits. First, a critical-size osteochondral defect was created in the femora of the animals and subsequently filled with the ELR-based hydrogel alone or with embedded hMSCs. Regeneration outcomes were evaluated after three months by gross assessment, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, showing complete filling of the defect and the de novo formation of hyaline-like cartilage and subchondral bone in the hMSC-treated knees. Furthermore, histological sectioning and staining of every sample confirmed regeneration of the full cartilage thickness and early subchondral bone repair, which was more similar to the native cartilage in the case of the cell-loaded ELR-based hydrogel. Overall histological differences between the two groups were assessed semi-quantitatively using the Wakitani scale and found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence against a human mitochondrial antibody three months post-implantation showed that the hMSCs were integrated into the de novo formed tissue, thus suggesting their ability to overcome the interspecies barrier. Hence, we conclude that the use of xenogeneic MSCs embedded in an ELR-based hydrogel leads to the successful regeneration of hyaline cartilage in osteochondral lesions.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In this study, we used TE as injection medium, and compared it with classic media in MSCs intra-articular injection such as normal saline (NS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and platelet-rich plasma (PRP). We found that TE could effectively improve adhesion, migration, chondrogenic differentiation of infrapatellar fat pad MSCs (IPFP-MSCs) and enhance matrix synthesis of osteoarthritic chondrocytes (OACs) in indirect-coculture system.

This review covers the use of fibrin gel polymer as an injectable scaffold for generating new cartilage matrix from isolated articular chondrocytes beginning with studies in mice and culminating in an applied study in swine joints. These studies began with developing a formulation of fibrin that was injectable and promoted cartilage matrix formation. Subsequent studies addressed the problems of volume loss after the scaffolds were placed in vivo by adding lyophilized cartilage matrix. Additional studies focused on the ability of isolated chondrocytes to heal and repair cartilage in a model that could be biomechanically tested. In conclusion, this series of studies demonstrated that fibrin gel is a suitable polymer gel for generating new cartilage matrix from articular chondrocytes. The new matrix is capable of forming mechanical bonds between cartilage disks and can lead to healing and integration. Armed with these results, implantation of fibrin-cell constructs into defects in swine knees showed new cartilage formation and filling of the defects. Continuing work in these models with fibrin and other polymerizable hydrogels could result in a suitable cell-based therapy for articular cartilage lesions.",2006,Jeyaraman_2020,0

On the other side, OC lesions themselves, getting worse over time, can lead to OA, indicating that chondral and OC defects represent a risk factor for the onset of the pathology. Many animal models have been set up for years for the study of OC regeneration, being successfully employed to test different treatment strategies, from biomaterials and cells to physical and biological adjuvant therapies. These studies rely on a plethora of post-explant investigations ranging from histological and histomorphometric analyses to biomechanical ones. The present review aims to analyze the methods employed for the evaluation of OC treatments in each animal model by screening literature data within the last 10 years. According to the selected research criteria performed in two databases, 60 works were included. Data revealed that lapine (50% of studies) and ovine (23% of studies) models are predominant, and knee joints are the most used anatomical locations for creating OC defects. Analyses are mostly conducted on paraffin-embedded samples in order to perform histological/histomorphometric analyses by applying semiquantitative scoring systems and on fresh samples in order to perform biomechanical investigations by indentation tests on articular cartilage. Instead, a great heterogeneity is pointed out in terms of OC defect dimensions and animal's age. The choice of experimental times is generally adequate for the animal models adopted, although few studies adopt very long experimental times. Improvements in data reporting and in standardization of protocols would be desirable for a better comparison of results and for ethical reasons related to appropriate and successful animal experimentation.",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The method is based on an implantation of in vitro expanded chondrocytes originating from a small cartilage biopsy harvested from a non-weight-bearing area within the joint. In patients with osteoarthritis (OA), there is a need for the resurfacing of large areas, which could potentially be made by using a scaffold in combination with culture-expanded cells. As a first step towards a cell-based therapy for OA, we therefore investigated the expansion and redifferentiation potential in vitro of chondrocytes isolated from patients undergoing total knee replacement. The results demonstrate that OA chondrocytes have a good proliferation potential and are able to redifferentiate in a three-dimensional pellet model. During the redifferentiation, the OA cells expressed increasing amounts of DNA and proteoglycans, and at day 14 the cells from all donors contained type II collagen-rich matrix. The accumulation of proteoglycans was in comparable amounts to those from ACT donors, whereas total collagen was significantly lower in all of the redifferentiated OA chondrocytes. When the OA chondrocytes were loaded into a scaffold based on hyaluronic acid, they bound to the scaffold and produced cartilage-specific matrix proteins. Thus, autologous chondrocytes are a potential source for the biological treatment of OA patients but the limited collagen synthesis of the OA chondrocytes needs to be further explained.",2005,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Different from the traditional oxidizing method, we first introduced an amino-diethoxypropane to the alginate and formed hemiacetal group on it. The hydrogel was formed when the modified alginate met with chitosan. We characterized the chemical and rheological properties of the hydrogel and investigated the growth of BMSC in hydrogel. Then, we used real-time qPCR to in vitro quantify the relative mRNA expressions of aggrecan, SOX9 and collagen II at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks, and found that these genes significantly presented higher expression in Group IV (BMSCs seeded in hydrogel in chondrogenic culture medium) than in BMSCs seeded in hydrogel in routine medium group (Group II) or BMSCs in chondrogenic culture medium group (Group III). For further testing, we implanted BMSCs laden hydrogel to a rabbit knee cartilage defect model. After 12 weeks, the BMSCs laden hydrogel group presented a better repair than other groups in gross appearance using ICRS histological grading system. The level of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) was measured, and the result showed 4.9-fold higher level of glycosaminoglycans in BMSCs laden hydrogel treated group than in the defect group. The result of real-time qPCR showed that the gene expression of aggrecan (5.8-fold), type II collagen (9-fold), proteoglycans (5.3-fold), and SOX9 (17.9-fold) were significantly higher in the BMSCs loaded hydrogel treated group than in defect group, but the type I collagen gene expression was lower (4.9-fold) in BMSCs loaded hydrogel treated group than in defect group. In the histology analysis of HE, Alcian blue, Toluidine blue, and Masson's trichrome staining, the results showed that the BMSCs laden hydrogel treated group formed more chondrocytes, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) than in the hydrogel treated group or defect group.

The defects were filled with either autologous cancellous bone or donor demineralized bone matrix or left empty as control. After 12 weeks of healing, the specimens were analyzed with radiography, macroscopy, microcomputed tomography, histology, histomorphometry, and fluorescence microscopy. It was possible to create a standardized defect in each talus. The implanted material remained in place. The analyses showed that most bony tissue was generated in the defects filled with autologous bone and least in the control defects.

Cementless implants are widely used in clinics to replace damaged cartilage or missing bone tissue. In cementless arthroplasty, the risk of aseptic loosening strictly depends on implant stability and bone-implant interface, which are fundamental to guarantee the long-term success of the implant. Ameliorating the features of prosthetic materials, including their porosity and/or geometry, and identifying osteoconductive and/or osteoinductive coatings of implant surfaces are the main strategies to enhance the bone-implant contact surface area. Herein, the development of a novel composite consisting in the association of macro-porous trabecular titanium with silk fibroin (SF) sponges enriched with anionic fibroin-derived polypeptides is described. This composite is applied to improve early bone ingrowth into the implant mesh in a sheep model of bone defects. The composite enables to nucleate carbonated hydroxyapatite and accelerates the osteoblastic differentiation of resident cells, inducing an outward bone growth, a feature that can be particularly relevant when applying these implants in the case of poor osseointegration.

Rigorous radiographic assessment is important to discern the type of dysplasia, notably the presence of a potentially pathogenic supra-trochlear spur.

This scaffold was assembled by a newly developed method that guarantees the strict integration between the organic and the inorganic parts, mimicking the biological tissue between the chondral and the osseous phase. Thirty-six osteochondral lesions were created in the trochlea of six pigs; in each pig, two lesions were treated with scaffolds seeded with autologous chondrocytes (cell+group), two lesions were treated with unseeded scaffolds (cell- group), and the two remaining lesions were left untreated (untreated group). After 3 months, the animals were sacrificed and the newly formed tissue was analyzed to evaluate the degree of maturation. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) macroscopic assessment showed significantly higher scores in the cell- and untreated groups when compared with the cell+ group. Histological evaluation showed the presence of repaired tissue, with fibroblast-like and hyaline-like areas in all groups; however, with respect to the other groups, the cell- group showed significantly higher values in the ICRS II histological scores for ""cell morphology"" and for the ""surface/superficial assessment."" While the scaffold seeded with autologous chondrocytes promoted the formation of a reparative tissue with high cellularity but low glycosaminoglycans (GAG) production, on the contrary, the reparative tissue observed with the unseeded scaffold presented lower cellularity but higher and uniform GAG distribution. Finally, in the lesions treated with scaffolds, the immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of collagen type II in the peripheral part of the defect, indicating tissue maturation due to the migration of local cells from the surroundings. This study showed that the novel osteochondral scaffold was easy to handle for surgical implantation and was stable within the site of lesion; at the end of the experimental time, all implants were well integrated with the surrounding tissue and no signs of synovitis were observed. The quality of the reparative tissue seemed to be superior for the lesions treated with the unseeded scaffolds, indicating the promising potential of this novel biomaterial for use in a one-stage procedure for osteochondral repair.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Among all the biofabrication approaches, bioprinting based on inkjet printing technology has the promises to deliver and create biomimicked tissue with high throughput, digital control, and the capacity of single cell manipulation. Therefore, this enabling technology has great potential in regenerative medicine and translational applications. The most current advances in organ and tissue bioprinting based on the thermal inkjet printing technology are described in this review, including vasculature, muscle, cartilage, and bone. In addition, the benign side effect of bioprinting to the printed mammalian cells can be utilized for gene or drug delivery, which can be achieved conveniently during precise cell placement for tissue construction. With layer-by-layer assembly, three-dimensional tissues with complex structures can be printed using converted medical images. Therefore, bioprinting based on thermal inkjet is so far the most optimal solution to engineer vascular system to the thick and complex tissues. Collectively, bioprinting has great potential and broad applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

The best way to face the challenge is to develop a biomimetic construct to mimic the multilayered gradient from cartilage, to calcified cartilage and subchondral bone. In this study, bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) were cultured on electrospun fibrous meshes and cell sheets were incubated. The fibrous meshes were composed of 50% poly(L-lactide) and 50% gelatin, displaying excellent biocompatibility, cell affinity and degradability. Differentiation of BMSC sheets on fibrous meshes was induced chondrogenically or osteogenically. In particular, the BMSC sheets were able to be efficiently induced differentiating towards calcified cartilage by using a 1:1 (v/v) mixed medium of chondrogenic and osteogenic inductive media. Thus, a gradient 3D construct was built by stacking the differently pre-differentiated cell/mesh complexes layer by layer from top to bottom to mimic the cartilage-to-bone transition. With this gradient construct being implanted in the rabbit knee osteochondral defect, it was confirmed that it could promote the tissue regeneration with intact cartilage layer formation in comparison with the multilayered construct without a gradient. The strategy of using properly pre-differentiated BMSC sheet on fibrous mesh to build the osteochondral interface was thus suggested as being feasible and effective in mimicking its hierarchical complexity, and favored the repairing of injured joint cartilage.",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Recently, osteochondral autografting has gained popularity for use in small cartilage injuries. The aims of this study were to characterize the SONK lesion histopathologically and to report on preliminary clinical results of autogenous osteochondral grafting for SONK. Six patients with SONK of the medial femoral condyle underwent osteochondral autografting. Average age was 54.2 years (range, 50-57 years). Using Koshino's classification, three patients' lesions were classified as stage III and three as stage IV. Classical histological investigation of the lesions was performed in all cases. All the patients achieved favorable pain relief after osteochondral autografts. The mean duration of follow-up was 27.7 months (range, 23-45 months). An increase in the average Lysholm score was found, ranging from 54.7 preoperatively to 92.3 postoperatively. Histological investigation of the lesions revealed articular bone plate fracture with enchondral ossification, reactive cartilage tissue formation, and proliferation of fibrous tissue. An area of osteonecrosis was observed in detached or fragmented osteochondral lesions.

These techniques are intended to penetrate the subchondral bone to elicit bleeding and allow precursor cells and cytokines from bone marrow to populate the lesion. However, the fibrocartilaginous repair tissue arising after marrow stimulation confers inferior mechanical and biological properties compared with the original hyaline cartilage. The limitations of BMS can be overcome by the use of the soluble chitosan-based polymer BST-CarGel (Piramal Life Sciences, Laval, Quebec, Canada). When mixed with freshly drawn autologous whole blood and applied to a lesion surgically prepared by BMS, BST-CarGel acts as a natural bioscaffold that increases the quantity and improves the residency of the blood clot formed in the cartilage lesion, enhancing the local healing response.

34277134,Osteochondral Autograft Transplantation for Capitellar Osteochondritis Dissecans.,Dan A Zlotolow,"The goal of the osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) procedure is to replace both the bone and cartilage that have been compromised by osteonecrosis of the capitellum, a condition known as osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). In children, the vascularity of the capitellum is limited compared with that in adults because the physis acts as a physical barrier to vascular ingrowth from the metaphysis to the epiphysis. The necrotic subchondral bone cannot keep up with the weight-bearing demands of certain high-level athletes such as gymnasts, accumulating microfractures and eventually crumbling. Without the support of the subchondral bone, the overlying cartilage fractures and eventually comes loose, often floating around the joint as a loose body. Fibrocartilage may form to fill the void left behind but cannot restore either the structural integrity of the bone or the gliding and compressive properties of hyaline cartilage. Replacement of both the bone and the cartilage requires an osteochondral transplant. Fortunately, there are regions of the articular surface of the knee in which there is minimal load or contact and that are therefore expendable as donor osteochondral plugs. We prefer a single-plug technique whenever possible because it is easier to perform and only requires union of the plug to native bone across 1 interface. If a single plug will not cover the defect or cannot be made to match the contour of the capitellum, multiple plugs may be used (i.e., mosaicplasty).",2021,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Studies have shown that meniscal repairs have better outcomes over both partial and total meniscectomies. Tissue engineering strategies to repair meniscus tears have been explored using cell sources that involve a donor as well as a period of in vitro cell expansion before use. This study explored cell sources that could be easily harvested and rapidly isolated by enzymatic digestion and cannulated delivery. Methods. Bovine menisci were used to create a bucket handle tear. Cell lines were established from meniscus, synovium, and adipose tissue and fluorescently labeled. At passages P2, P4, and P8, cells were added to the defect from the following experimental groups: cells alone, collagen gel, collagen scaffold, or hyaluronic acid. Menisci constructs were xenografted subcutaneously onto the dorsum of athymic rats and incubated for 3, 6, and 9 weeks, at which time they were retrieved and processed for histology. Results. Meniscal cells were able to repair defects faster and significantly better than adipose or synovium derived cells. Adipose cells were the least effective in comparison. Repair was significantly better at 9 weeks compared with 6 and 3 weeks. Macroscopic examination of menisci that received cell implants showed the thickest tissue in menisci that had collagen implants, and the thinnest fill occurred in menisci treated with cells alone. Histology confirmed no cells or integrative repair in the control specimens. Conclusions. Delivery of cells alone outperformed the additional use of biomaterials. Our results suggest a strategy that would use both meniscus and synovial cells for arthroscopic meniscal repair.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

This technique entails combining bone marrow aspirate concentrate or concentrated platelet-rich plasma with demineralized bone matrix as a bone substitute before injecting into a subchondral bone defect under fluoroscopic guidance. The principles of IOBP as a procedure that combines core decompression with biologic bone substitute augmentation can be extended to treat subchondral bone marrow lesions such as acetabular and femoral cysts in degenerative hip OA. Intraosseous bioplasty of the hip, in particular the acetabulum, when done using this technique, is a useful alternative that can be beneficial in treating young patients with early hip arthritis to achieve successful outcomes while delaying more invasive procedures. The Technical Note described here presents a step-by-step approach, including tips and pearls for arthroscopic-assisted IOBP with decompression of the subchondral cyst in the acetabulum followed by bone substitute injection under fluoroscopic guidance.

There may be no problem if there is depression of the grafted plugs, but graft protuberance may have an adverse effect. We studied five knees in five patients who had incongruity (protuberance or depression) of grafted osteochondral plugs at the time of mosaicplasty. The mean age at surgery was 36.6 years (range, 15-65 years), and the mean follow-up period was 32.9 months (range, 24-49 months). All patients underwent second-look arthroscopy after a mean post-surgical period of 14.8 months (range, 3-18 months). We divided the cases so that there were two in the protuberant group (P) and three in the depressed group (D). In P, all patients had a catching sensation about 4 months after surgery, and sometimes pain in the knee joint. Second-look arthroscopy revealed fissuring of the plugs and fibrillation around the recipient site. In D, there were no symptoms due to the depressed plugs. Second-look arthroscopy showed that the depressed areas were covered with fibrocartilage-like tissue, and that the joint surface was smooth. In conclusion, our clinical results and second-look arthroscopic evaluation suggest that isolated osteochondral plug depressions of not greater than 1 mm could still promote acceptable cartilage healing leading to good clinical outcomes.

Several surgical procedures have been devised in an attempt to relieve pain, restore function, and delay or stop the progression of cartilaginous lesions. Advanced MRI and ultrasonography protocols are currently used in the evaluation of tissue repair and to improve diagnostic capability. Other nonoperative modalities, such as injection of intra-articular hyaluronic acid or supplementary oral glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, have shown potential efficacy as anti-inflammatory and symptom-modifying agents. The emerging field of tissue engineering, involving the use of a biocompatible, structurally and mechanically stable scaffold, has shown promising early results in cartilage tissue repair. Scaffolds incorporating specific cell sources and bioactive molecules have been the focus in this new exciting field. Further work is required to better understand the behavior of chondrocytes and the variables that influence their ability to heal articular lesions.

However, the combined regeneration of hierarchical osteochondral tissue remains a challenge due to delamination between cartilage and subchondral bone or difficulty in spatial control over differentiation of transplanted stem cells. Here, two types of composite spheroids are prepared using adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and nanofibers coated with either transforming growth factor-β3 or bone morphogenetic growth factor-2 for chondrogenesis or osteogenesis, respectively. Each type of spheroid is then cultured within a 3D-printed microchamber in a spatially arranged manner to recapitulate the bilayer structure of osteochondral tissue. The presence of inductive factors regionally modulates in vitro chondrogenic or osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs within the biphasic construct without dedifferentiation. Furthermore, hADSCs from each spheroid proliferate and sprout and successfully connect the two layers mimicking the osteochondral interface without apertures. In vivo transplantation of the biphasic construct onto a femoral trochlear groove defect in rabbit knee joint results in 21.2 ± 2.8% subchondral bone volume/total volume and a cartilage score of 25.0 ± 3.7.

In fact, to promote the growth of articular cartilage and subchondral bone is a real challenge, due to the different functional and anatomical properties. To this purpose, alginate is a promising biomaterial for a scaffold-based approach, claiming optimal biocompatibility and good chondrogenic potential. A previously developed mineralized alginate scaffold was investigated in terms of the ability to support osteochondral regeneration both in a large and medium size animal model. The results were evaluated macroscopically and by microtomography, histology, histomorphometry, and immunohistochemical analysis. No evidence of adverse or inflammatory reactions was observed in both models, but limited subchondral bone formation was present, together with a slow scaffold resorption time.The implantation of this biphasic alginate scaffold provided partial osteochondral regeneration in the animal model.

The chemical, mechanical, and rheological properties of the hydrogel/microparticle were investigated. For in vitro evaluation, the adipose-derived stem cells might be mixed with hydrogel/microparticles, then cellular viability was analyzed by acridine orange/propidium iodide and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining and also dimethylmethylene blue assay were conducted to find the amount of proteoglycan. The real-time polymerase chain reaction for aggrecan, sex-determining region Y-Box 9, collagen I (COL1), and COL2 gene expression was performed after 14 and 21 days. For evaluation of cartilage regeneration, the samples were implanted in rabbit knees with cartilaginous experimental defects. Defects were created in both knees of three groups of rabbits. Group 1 was the control with no injection, and Groups 2 and 3 were loaded with hydrogel/cell and hydrogel/microparticle/cell; respectively. Then, after 3 and 6 months, histological evaluations of the defected sites were carried out. The amount of glycosaminoglycans after 14 and 21 days increased significantly in hydrogels/microparticles loaded with cells.

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the effect of the level of in vitro maturation of engineered cartilaginous samples on the tissue quality after in vivo implantation. Samples were obtained from isolated swine articular chondrocytes embedded in fibrin glue. The cell-fibrin composites were either cultured in vitro or directly implanted in vivo for 1, 5, and 9 weeks. Other experimental samples were precultured for either 1 or 5 weeks in vitro and then implanted in vivo for 4 additional weeks. All the samples were analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, and gene expression. The results strongly suggest that the in vivo culture in this model promoted a better tissue maturation than that obtained in the in vitro condition, and that 1 week in vitro preculture resulted in the primary structuring of the engineered composites and their subsequent maturation in vivo, without affecting the cell viability and activity, while a prolonged in vitro preculture caused a cell and matrix degeneration that could not be rescued in vivo.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

It can reduce ankle pain and allow performance of daily living activities and elementary sports. However, there are very little data on the restoration of normal life with large lesions. Our investigation focused on assessing outcomes in patients with large lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS The MOT operation was used, and the donor site was located at the lateral condyle of the femur. Clinical evaluation included the Berndt and Harty outcome question, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score (during rest, walking and running), American Orthopedic Foot and ankle Association (AOFAS) score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee evaluation form, and the Short Form 36 (SF-36). Twenty-four months after surgery, the graft binding was assessed by MRI using the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score. RESULTS We assessed 26 patients, including 14 males and 12 females. The average follow-up time was 33.9±5.2 months. The average lesion size was 173.1±23.5 mm². The average VAS score during rest improved from 4.62±0.85 preoperatively to 1.08±0.27 postoperatively (P<0.05), the score during walking improved from 5.19±0.63 preoperatively to 1.15±0.37 postoperatively (P<0.05), and the score during running improved from 6.08±0.74 preoperatively to 1.39±0.57 postoperatively (P<0.05). The average postoperative AOFAS ankle score improved to 91.5±2.6 (range, 88 to 96), compared with preoperative 75.0±2.8 (range, 70 to 79) (P<0.05). Two patients developed pain in the donor site of the knee joint, and both of them had 2 or more osteochondral plugs harvested. The postoperative SF-36 score increased to 92.2±2.4 (P<0.05). In the last follow-up, 18 patients answered the Berndt and Harty outcome question, all with ""good"" as the result. CONCLUSIONS MOT is a feasible choice for patients with larger lesions. It can improve the VAS/AOFAS/IKDC/SF-36 scores, and has high patient satisfaction. Graft incorporation helps improve patient quality of life. Our results indicate that a larger osteochondral plug area increases the risk of developing knee donor site pain.",2021,Jeyaraman_2020,0
34754741,"The ""BioHumi"" Humeral Head Elliptical Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation.","Eric E Peterson, Paul E Caldwell, Sara E Pearson","Cartilage defects of the humeral head in young, active patients provide a challenge to treating surgeons. The causes of humeral head osteochondral lesions are variable, but these lesions most commonly result from trauma and recurrent glenohumeral instability. Palliative and reparative techniques such as arthroscopic debridement and microfracture have traditionally been used as surgical treatment but have high failure rates. Similarly to surgical trends in the knee, cartilage restoration in the shoulder is becoming more prevalent in younger patients. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OAT) has been used as a joint-preserving surgical option to restore hyaline cartilage in multiple joints for decades. Although OAT is more commonly used to re-establish the subchondral bony architecture in the treatment of recurrent shoulder instability, the procedure may also be indicated in young, active patients with focal humeral head chondral defects. OAT has been shown in early studies to provide improvement in functional outcome scores and good long-term graft survival with relatively low rates of complications.

In the control group (CG), defects were left untreated. In the early-(ETG) and late-(LTG) treatment groups, defects were treated by an osteoperiosteal graft 1 and 12 weeks, respectively, after the index procedure. Synovial fluid (SF) samples were collected regularly and proteoglycan fragments (PF), total collagen (TC) and collagenase (MMP-1) levels were measured. Rabbits were killed at 4 (early period), 12 (intermediate period), or 24 (late period) weeks postoperatively. Histological examination indicated a more successful healing in both grafting groups than in the CG, but without any difference at any time period between the grafting groups. In the CG, PF, and TC levels in SF increased continuously until the late period, indicating an ongoing degenerative activity in the joints. In contrast, SF marker levels in both grafting groups indicated that normalization in joint metabolism could be achieved-at least partially-after treatment. However, PF levels in the SF showed that the treatment of defects in earlier stages might result in better outcomes since the negative effects were more prominent in chronic stages, presumably due to the more prolonged period of disturbed homeostasis. Thus, histological values and SF marker levels indicated that treatment of osteochondral defects at any time of the disease had a positive effect on healing when compared to no treatment. Early treatment might better assist the recovery of joint homeostasis than late treatment.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Without access to progenitor cells and the supply of blood and nutrients, the impaired articular cartilage would be short of the capability to self-repair. Although the present clinical treatments, including autogenous and allograft osteochondral transplantation, microfracture technique, and so forth, have shown some efficacies, their drawbacks, such as donor insufficiency and poor-integration with adjacent tissue, limit the satisfactory repair of articular cartilage defects and cause unsatisfied prognosis. Cartilage tissue engineering, involving the combination of progenitor cells with scaffolds, which serve as artificial extracellular matrices (ECMs), provides a promising strategy for cartilage regeneration. Recently, thermosensitive hydrogels have attracted much attention as scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering owing to their unique physical properties analogous to the native ECM.

However, the menisci have limited healing potential due to the paucity of vascularity. The purpose of the present study was to test the feasibility of a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to repair incurable meniscal lesions. Porcine synovial MSCs were cultured in monolayers at high density in the presence of ascorbic acid followed by the suspension culture to develop a three-dimensional cell/matrix construct (TEC). A 4-mm cylindrical defect was created bilaterally in the medial meniscus of skeletally mature miniature pigs. The defects were implanted with an allogenic TEC or were left empty. After 6 months, the TEC-treated defects were consistently repaired by a fibro-cartilaginous tissue with good tissue integration to the adjacent host meniscal tissue, while the untreated were either partially or not repaired. The ratio of Safranin O positive area within the central body of the meniscus adjacent to the original defect was significantly higher in the TEC-treated group than in the control group. Moreover, TEC treatment significantly reduced the size and severity of post-traumatic chondral lesions on the tibial plateau.

We hypothesized that pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) would improve growth and healing of tissue-engineered cartilage grafts in a direction-dependent manner. PEMF stimulation of engineered cartilage constructs was first evaluated in vitro using passaged adult canine chondrocytes embedded in an agarose hydrogel scaffold. PEMF coils oriented parallel to the articular surface induced superior repair stiffness compared to both perpendicular PEMF (p = .026) and control (p = .012). This was correlated with increased glycosaminoglycan deposition in both parallel and perpendicular PEMF orientations compared to control (p = .010 and .028, respectively). Following in vitro optimization, the potential clinical translation of PEMF was evaluated in a preliminary in vivo preclinical adult canine model. Engineered osteochondral constructs (∅ 6 mm × 6 mm thick, devitalized bone base) were cultured to maturity and implanted into focal defects created in the stifle (knee) joint. To assess expedited early repair, animals were assessed after a 3-month recovery period, with microfracture repairs serving as an additional clinical control. In vivo, PEMF led to a greater likelihood of normal chondrocyte (odds ratio [OR]: 2.5, p = .051) and proteoglycan (OR: 5.0, p = .013) histological scores in engineered constructs. Interestingly, engineered constructs outperformed microfracture in clinical scoring, regardless of PEMF treatment (p < .05).

This study investigated the biochemistry and molecular characterization of chondrocytes isolated from preserved cartilage for purposes of transplantation. Ex vivo characterization was accomplished by storing human cartilage at either 4 or -80 °C in a preservation medium. Microscopic evaluation of the preserved cartilage was conducted after 1, 2, 3 and 6 weeks. The chondrocytes were isolated from the preserved cartilage and investigated for proliferation capacity and chondrogenic phenotype. Transplantation of chondrocytes from preserved cartilage into rabbit knees was performed for purposes of in vivo evaluation. The serum cartilage degradation biomarker (WF6 epitopes) was evaluated during the transplantation procedure. Human cartilage preserved for 1 week in a 10 % DMSO chondrogenic medium at 4 °C gave the highest chondrocyte viability. The isolated chondrocytes showed a high proliferative capacity and retained chondrogenic gene expression. Microscopic assessment of the implanted rabbit knees showed tissue regeneration and integration with the host cartilage. A decreased level of the serum biomarker after transplantation was evidence of in vivo repair by the implanted chondrocytes. These results suggest that cartilage preservation for 1 week in a 10 % DMSO chondrogenic medium at 4 °C can maintain proliferation capacity and the chondrogenic phenotype of human chondrocytes. These results can potentially be applied to in vivo allogeneic chondrocyte transplantation. Allogeneic chondrocytes from preserved cartilage would be expected to maintain their chondrogenic phenotype and to result in a high rate of success in transplanted grafts.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation embedded in scaffolds are used to treat cartilage defects with favorable outcomes. Autologous serum is often used as a medium for chondrocyte cell culture during the proliferation phase of the process of such products. A previous report showed that opiate analgesics (fentanyl, alfentanil and diamorphine) in the sera have a significant inhibitory effect on chondrocyte proliferation. In order to determine if opiates in serum inhibit chondrocyte proliferation, twenty two patients who underwent knee arthroscopy and were anesthetized with either fentanyl or remifentanil were studied. Blood was drawn before and during opiate administration and up to 2 h after its discontinuation. The sera were used as medium for in vitro proliferation of both cryopreserved and freshly isolated chondrocytes, and the number and viability of cells were measured. There was no difference in the yield or cell viability between the serum samples of patients anesthetized with fentanyl when either fresh or cryopreserved human articular chondrocytes (hACs) were used. Some non-significant reduction in the yield of cells was observed in the serum samples of patients anesthetized with remifentanil when fresh hAC were used. We conclude that Fentanyl in human autologous serum does not inhibit in vitro hAC proliferation.

Therefore, wide-ranging cartilage damage rarely resolves spontaneously. Cartilage damage is typically treated by chondrocyte transplantation, mosaicplasty or microfracture. Recent advances in tissue engineering have prompted research on techniques to repair articular cartilage damage using a variety of transplanted cells. We studied the repair and regeneration of cartilage damage using layered chondrocyte sheets prepared on a temperature-responsive culture dish. We previously reported achieving robust tissue repair when covering only the surface layer with layered chondrocyte sheets when researching partial-thickness defects in the articular cartilage of domestic rabbits. The present study was an experiment on the repair and regeneration of articular cartilage in a minipig model of full-thickness defects. Good safranin-O staining and integration with surrounding tissues was achieved in animals transplanted with layered chondrocyte sheets. However, tissue having poor safranin-O staining-not noted in the domestic rabbit experiments-was identified in some of the animals, and the subchondral bone was poorly repaired in these. Thus, although layered chondrocyte sheets facilitate articular cartilage repair, further investigations into appropriate animal models and culture and transplant conditions are required.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

OC tissue from the sheep femur were obtained and decellularized. The decellularized ECM (dECM) was combined with either platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), amniotic membrane extract (AME), or rabbit bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (rBMSCs). The hybrid dECM-biological products were then utilized for the treatment of rabbit OC critical size defects. The regenerative potential of different groups was compared using; MRI, macroscopic assessment, histopathology, and histomorphometry. All characterizations analysis verified successful decellularization. Three months post-surgery, macroscopic findings indicated that dECM was better compared to controls. Also, dECM in combination with AME, PRF, and rBMSCs showed enhanced OC regeneration compared to only dECM (AME: +100%, PRF: +61%, rBMSCs: +28%). In particular, the dECM+AME group results in the best integration of new cartilage into surrounding cartilage tissue. The histomorphometric evaluations demonstrated enhancement in new cartilage formation and bone tissue (86.5 ± 5.9% and 90 ± 7.7%, respectively) for the dECM+AME group compared to other groups. Furthermore, histological results for the dECM+AME elucidated a mature hyaline cartilage tissue that covered the new and symmetrically formed subchondral bone, exhibiting a significantly higher regenerative effect compared to all other treated groups. This finding was also confirmed with MRI images. The current study revealed that in addition to the benefits of dECM alone, its combination with AME indicated to have a superior regenerative effect on OC regeneration. Overall, dECM+AME may be considered a suitable construct for treating knee OC injuries.",2022,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The aims of this study were to investigate the use of a scaffold-assisted microfracture approach, employing a novel, multilayered, collagen-based, osteochondral graft substitute in the treatment of severe osteochondritis dissecans of both lateral femoral trochlear ridges in an equine athlete, and to assess the potential of this novel scaffold to enhance repair of the osteochondral unit. A 15 month-old female filly presented with large osteochondritis dissecans lesions involving both femoral lateral trochlear ridges. After routine arthroscopic debridement and microfracture of the subchondral bone, multilayered osteochondral defect repair scaffolds were implanted into the fragmentation beds in both left and right femoropatellar joints via mini-arthrotomies. Exploratory arthroscopy 5 months postimplantation revealed smooth cartilaginous repair tissue, contiguous with the adjacent cartilage, covering the defect. At 22-month follow up, the filly had no signs of lameness and was exercising at her intended level. Radiographically, although still slightly flattened, the femoral trochlear ridges were smooth, with no evidence of osteoarthritis. Ultrasonographically, the defects were filled with bone and covered with an overlying cartilaginous layer, with the trochlear ridge contour almost entirely restored. This report demonstrates the effective clinical use of this novel, multilayered, osteochondral defect repair scaffold in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of an equine athlete. The successful repair achieved here using this novel scaffold in an equine patient with large bilateral lesions shows the potential for clinical translation in the treatment of human patients presenting with osteochondral defects.

Donor site morbidity and interference with joint homeostasis should be considered when applying the autologous chondrocyte transplantation technique. The use of ectopically produced cartilage, derived from periosteum, might be a novel method to heal cartilage defects. Ectopic cartilage was produced by dissecting a piece of periosteum from the tibia of rabbits. After 14 days the reactive tissue at the dissection site was harvested and a graft was cored out and press-fit implanted in an osteochondral defect in the medial condyle of the femur with or without addition of hyaluronan. After 3 weeks and 3 months the repair reaction was evaluated by histology. Thionine- and collagen type II-stained sections were evaluated for graft viability, ingrowth of the graft, and joint surface repair. Empty defects remained empty 3 weeks after implantation, ectopic cartilage filled the defect to the level of the surrounding cartilage. Histologically, the grafts were viable, consisting mainly of cartilage, and showed a variable pattern of ingrowth. Three months after implantation empty defects with or without hyaluronan were filled primarily with fibrocartilaginous tissue. Defects treated with ectopic cartilage contained mixtures of fibrocartilaginous and hyaline cartilage. Sometimes a tidemark was observed in the new articular cartilage and the orientation of the cells resembled that of healthy articular cartilage. Subchondral bone repair was excellent. The modified O'Driscoll scores for empty defects without and with hyaluronan were 12.7 +/- 6.4 and 15.3 +/- 3.2; for treated defects scores were better (15.4 +/- 3.9 and 18.2 +/- 2.9). In this conceptual study the use of ectopic cartilage derived from periosteum appears to be a promising novel method for joint surface repair in rabbits.",2005,Jeyaraman_2020,0

A new multilayer gradient nano-composite scaffold was obtained by nucleating collagen fibrils with hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. In the femoral condyles of 12 sheep, 24 osteochondral lesions were created. Animals were randomized into three treatment groups: scaffold alone, scaffold colonized in vitro with autologous chondrocytes and empty defects. Six months after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and the lesions were histologically evaluated. Histologic and gross evaluation of specimens showed good integration of the chondral surface in all groups except for the control group. Significantly better bone regeneration was observed both in the group receiving the scaffold alone and in the group with scaffold loaded with autologous chondrocytes. No difference in cartilage surface reconstruction and osteochondral defect filling was noted between cell-seeded and cell-free groups. In the control group, no bone or cartilage defect healing occurred, and the defects were filled with fibrous tissue. Quantitative macroscopic and histological score evaluations confirmed the qualitative trends observed. The results of the present study showed that this novel osteochondral scaffold is safe and easy to use, and may represent a suitable matrix to direct and coordinate the process of bone and hyaline-like cartilage regeneration.

Importantly, untreated lesions lead to a high rate of osteoarthritis. The current strategies to repair these defects include osteochondral autograft transplantation or ""sandwich"" strategies combining bone autografts with autologous chondrocyte implantation, with poorly documented long-term outcomes. In this study, we first investigated the capacity of juvenile osteochondral grafts (OCGs) to repair osteochondral defects in skeletally mature rats.

Consequently, a tissue engineering approach to cartilage regenerative therapy could greatly advance the current treatment options for patients with cartilage degeneration and/or defects. A successful tissue engineering approach would require not only induction of chondrogenic differentiation, but also suppression of subsequent endochondral ossification and chondrocyte dedifferentiation. We previously reported that direct injection of the thienoindazole derivative, TD-198946, into the knee joints of mice halted the progression of osteoarthritis; the compound induced chondrogenic differentiation without promoting endochondral ossification. In the present study, we applied TD-198946 to a cell-based cartilage reconstruction model, taking advantage of the cell-sheet technology. Cartilaginous cell-sheets were generated by culturing mouse and canine costal chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells with TD-198946 on temperature-responsive dishes. The transplanted cell-sheets were then successfully used to promote the reconstruction of permanent cartilage, with no evidence of chondrocyte hypertrophy in the knee articular cartilage defects created in mice and canines. Thus, TD-198946 is a promising candidate for cell-based cartilage reconstruction therapies, enabling us to avoid any concern surrounding the use of scaffolds or cytokines to stimulate regeneration.",2013,Jeyaraman_2020,0

We report an approach for noninvasive detection of stem cell apoptosis with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), based on a caspase-3-sensitive nanoaggregation MRI probe (C-SNAM). C-SNAM self-assembles into nanoparticles after hydrolysis by caspase-3, leading to 90% amplification of (1)H MR signal and prolonged in vivo retention. Following intra-articular injection, C-SNAM causes significant MR signal enhancement in apoptotic MASI compared to viable MASI.

However, hydrogels possess only limited mechanical strength, and must therefore be reinforced for applications in load-bearing conditions. In most approaches the reinforcing component and the hydrogel network have poor interactions and the synergetic effect of both materials on the mechanical properties is not effective. Therefore, in the present study, a thermoplastic polymer blend of poly(hydroxymethylglycolide-co-ε-caprolactone)/poly(ε-caprolactone) (pHMGCL/PCL) was functionalized with methacrylate groups (pMHMGCL/PCL) and covalently grafted to gelatin methacrylamide (gelMA) hydrogel through photopolymerization. The grafting resulted in an at least fivefold increase in interface-binding strength between the hydrogel and the thermoplastic polymer material. GelMA constructs were reinforced with three-dimensionally printed pHMGCL/PCL and pMHMGCL/PCL scaffolds and tested in a model for a focal articular cartilage defect. In this model, covalent bonds at the interface of the two materials resulted in constructs with an improved resistance to repeated axial and rotational forces.

Different surface roughness modifications and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) coating densities were first tested in vitro on TPU discs. The in vivo osseointegration of BCP-coated TPU implants was subsequently compared to uncoated TPU implants and the titanium bottom layer of metal control implants in a caprine model.

Accordingly, the restoration of articular surface integrity is of major importance, especially in young adults where, in lesions left untreated or following simple fragment excision, early osteoarthritis can be anticipated. Therefore, the treatment algorithm in unstable knee OCD of the young adult foresees surgical options to restore the articular surface. Several procedures have been proposed, including refixation of the detached fragment bone marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft implantation, fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation, and cell-based or cell-free regenerative techniques. The aim of this review was to summarize the evidence for these surgical strategies, reporting their results and limitations. The overall evidence documents positive results for each of the assorted surgical procedures applied to treat unstable OCD, thus indicating support for their selected use to treat osteochondral defects paying particular attention to their specific indications for the lesion characteristics. The fixation of a good quality fragment should be pursued as a first option, while unfixable small lesions may benefit from autografts. For large lesions, available cell-based or cell-free osteochondral scaffold are a feasible solution but with limitation in terms of regenerated tissue quality. In this light, fresh allografts may offer articular surface restoration with viable physiologic osteochondral tissue providing a predictably successful outcome, and therefore they may currently represent the most suitable option to treat unstable irreparable OCD lesion in young adults.

The as-prepared biphasic scaffolds were implanted into rabbit knees for 1 and 3 months (PLGA/Ti group), and the porous PLGA (PLGA group) or empty defect (Untreated group) was also used. The results showed that both porous PLGA and porous Ti had an interconnected porous structure. The mechanical strength of porous PLGA and porous Ti was similar to that of cartilage and subchondral bone, respectively. The interface analysis revealed that the as-prepared biphasic scaffold had good overall integrity and interface stability. The gross observation and histological evaluation of specimens showed that hyaline-like cartilage filled the defects to a certain extent at 3 months for both PLGA/Ti and PLGA groups while the defects remained in an untreated group.

Twenty adult goats were used for the study. A 6 mm circular full-thickness cartilage defect was created in both medial femoral condyles. The defects were randomized to the following four treatment groups. (1) Empty defect (control). (2) Subchondral drilling (control). (3) Fibrin hydrogel with autologous chondrocytes.

23216161,Repair of large animal partial-thickness cartilage defects through intraarticular injection of matrix-rejuvenated synovium-derived stem cells.,"Ming Pei, Fan He, Jingting Li, John E Tidwell, Alvin C Jones, E Barry McDonough","Cartilage defects have a limited ability to self-heal. Stem cell treatment is a promising approach; however, replicative senescence is a challenge to acquiring large-quantity and high-quality stem cells for cartilage regeneration. Synovium-derived stem cells (SDSCs) are a tissue-specific stem cell for cartilage regeneration. Our recent findings suggest that decellularized stem cell matrix (DSCM) can rejuvenate expanded SDSCs in cell proliferation and chondrogenic potential. In this study, we were investigating (1) whether transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and TGF-β3 played a similar role in chondrogenic induction of SDSCs after expansion on either DSCM or plastic flasks (plastic), and (2) whether DSCM-expanded SDSCs had an enhanced capacity in repairing partial-thickness cartilage defects in a minipig model. SDSCs were isolated from synovium in two 3-month-old pigs and DSCM was prepared using SDSCs. Passage 2 SDSCs were expanded on either DSCM or plastic for one passage. The expanded cells were evaluated for cell morphology, chondrogenic capacity, and related mechanisms. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were compared for their role in chondrogenesis of SDSCs after expansion on either DSCM or plastic. The chondrogenic induction medium without TGF-β served as a control. In 13 minipigs, we intraarticularly injected DSCM- or plastic-expanded SDSCs or saline into knee partial-thickness cartilage defects and assessed their repair using histology and immunohistochemistry. We found DSCM-expanded SDSCs were small, had a fibroblast-like shape, and grew quickly in a three-dimensional format with concomitant up-regulation of phosphocyclin D1 and TGF-β receptor II. Plastic-expanded SDSCs exhibited higher mRNA levels of chondrogenic markers when incubated with TGF-β3, while DSCM-expanded SDSCs displayed comparable chondrogenic potential when treated with either TGF-β isotype. In the minipig model, DSCM-expanded SDSCs were better than plastic-expanded SDSCs in enhancing collagen II and sulfated glycosaminoglycan expression in repair of partial-thickness cartilage defects, but both groups were superior to the saline control group. Our observations suggested that DSCM is a promising cell expansion system that can promote cell proliferation and enhance expanded cell chondrogenic potential in vitro and in vivo. Our approach could lead to a tissue-specific cell expansion system providing large-quantity and high-quality stem cells for the treatment of cartilage defects.",2013,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The outcomes of current clinical procedures aimed to address these injuries are inconsistent and unsatisfactory. We have developed a novel method for generating hyaline articular cartilage to improve the outcome of joint surface repair. A suspension of 10(7) swine chondrocytes was cultured under reciprocating motion for 14 days. The resulting dynamic self-regenerating cartilage (dSRC) was placed in a cartilage ring and capped with fibrin and collagen gel. A control group consisted of chondrocytes encapsulated in fibrin gel. Constructs were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and harvested after 6 weeks. Gross, histological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and biomechanical analyses were performed. In swine patellar groove, dSRC was implanted into osteochondral defects capped with collagen gel and compared to defects filled with osteochondral plugs, collagen gel, or left empty after 6 weeks. In mice, the fibrin- and collagen-capped dSRC constructs showed enhanced contiguous cartilage matrix formation over the control of cells encapsulated in fibrin gel. Biochemically, the fibrin and collagen gel dSRC groups were statistically improved in glycosaminoglycan and hydroxyproline content compared to the control. There was no statistical difference in the biomechanical data between the dSRC groups and the control. The swine model also showed contiguous cartilage matrix in the dSRC group but not in the collagen gel and empty defects. These data demonstrate the survivability and successful matrix formation of dSRC under the mechanical forces experienced by normal hyaline cartilage in the knee joint. The results from this study demonstrate that dSRC capped with hydrogels successfully engineers contiguous articular cartilage matrix in both nonload-bearing and load-bearing environments.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

These lesions can appear in many synovial joints of the body, such as the shoulder, elbow, hip, and ankle, occurring most often in the knee. The term osteochondral lesion includes a vast spectrum of pathologies such as osteochondritis dissecans, osteochondral defects, osteochondral fractures, and osteonecrosis of the subchondral bone. When considering this, the term osteochondral fracture is preserved only for an osteochondral defect that combines disruption of the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. These fractures commonly occur after sports practice and are associated with acute lateral patellar dislocations. Many of these lesions are initially diagnosed by plain radiographs; however, a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can add significant value to the diagnosis and treatment. Treatment methods may vary depending on the location and size of the fracture, fragment instability, and skeletal maturity. The paper reports a 14-year-old boy case with an osteochondral fracture due to sports trauma. The medical approach involved an arthrotomy of the knee, drainage of the hematoma, two Kirschner wires (K-wires) for temporary fixation to restructure anatomic alignment, and a titanium Herbert screw fixing the fracture permanently.

However, microfracture has drawbacks, which include the risk of ossification of the newly formed tissue, as well as the imperfect and fragile nature of the fibrous cartilage. Given the challenges associated with microfracture, BST-CarGel (Piramal Healthcare, Laval, Quebec, Canada) has been developed to stabilize and support the nascent clot. This chitin-based polymer is mixed with the patient's own blood and inserted onto the microfractured defect.

The main functions of articular cartilage are stress transmission, absorption, and friction reduction. The cartilage cannot be repaired and regenerated once it has been damaged, and it needs to be replaced by artificial joints. Many approaches, such as artificial joint replacement, hyaluronic acid injection, microfracture surgery and cartilage tissue engineering have been applied in clinical treatment. Basically, some of these approaches are foreign material implantation for joint replacement to reach the goal of pain reduction and mechanism support. This study demonstrated another frontier in the research of cartilage reconstruction by applying regeneration medicine additive manufacturing (3D Printing) and stem cell technology. Light curing materials have been modified and tested to be printable and cytocompatible for stem cells in this research. Design of experiments (DOE) is adapted in this investigation to search for the optimal manufacturing parameter for biocompatible scaffold fabrication and stem cell attachment and growth.

In the present study, tissue-engineered two-phase composite material was used for the repair of osteochondral defects in young adult rabbit knee. This composite material is composed of an injectable calcium phosphate (ICP) and a hyaluronan (HA) derivate of either ACP or HYAFF 11 sponge. The osteochondral defect, 3 mm in diameter and 3 mm deep, was created in the weight-bearing region of the medial femoral condyle. The bone portion of the defect was first filled with ICP to a level approximately 1 mm below the articular surface. HA sponge (3 mm in diameter and 1-1.2 mm thick), with or without loading of autologous bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (MPCs), was then inserted into the defect on top of the ICP as it hardened. Animals were allowed free cage activity postoperatively, and killed 4 or 12 weeks (for the HYAFF 11 sponge group) after the surgery. At 4 weeks, histological examination showed that the defect was filled up to 90-100% of its depth. Whitish repair tissue on the top appeared to be integrated with the surrounding articular cartilage. Four distinct zones of repair tissue were identified: a superficial layer, a chondroid tissue layer, an interface between HA sponge and ICP, and the ICP material. Evidence of extensive osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities was observed in the bone tissue surrounding the defect edge and in ICP material. By 12 weeks, the zonal features of the repair tissue became more distinct; chondrocytes were arranged in a columnar array, and a calcified layer of cartilage was formed beneath the chondroid tissue in some specimens. The healing tissue of the HA sponge material loaded with MPCs had higher cellular density and better integration with the surrounding cartilage than HA sponge material not loaded with MPCs. This study suggests that using a two-phase composite graft may hold potential for the repair of osteochondral defects by providing mechanical support that mimicks subchondral bone, while also providing a chondrogenic scaffold for the top cartilage repair.",2002,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Continuously graded interfacial designs, where there is no discrete transition from one tissue type to another, are gaining attention as an alternative to stratified designs. Given that osteochondral regeneration holds the potential to enhance cartilage regeneration by leveraging the healing capacity of the underlying bone, we endeavored to introduce a continuously-graded approach to osteochondral regeneration. The purpose of this study was thus to evaluate the performance of a novel gradient-based scaffolding approach to regenerate osteochondral defects in the New Zealand White rabbit femoral condyle. Bioactive plugs were constructed from poly(D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres with a continuous gradient transition between cartilage-promoting and bone-promoting growth factors. At 6 and 12 weeks of healing, results suggested that the implants provided support for the neo-synthesized tissue, and the gradient in bioactive signaling may have been beneficial for bone and cartilage regeneration compared to the blank control implant, as evidenced by histology. In addition, the effects of preseeding gradient scaffolds with umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UCMSCs) from the Wharton's jelly of New Zealand White rabbits were evaluated. Results indicated that there may be regenerative benefits to prelocalizing UCMSCs within scaffold interiors.

Insulin-like growth factor-I facilitates chondrogenesis of bone marrow-derived stem cells in long-term culture and may enhance chondrogenesis in healing cartilage lesions in vivo. This study examined the impact of insulin-like growth factor-I, gradually released from fibrin clots polymerized in situ, on the recruitable stem-cell pool in a full-thickness critical cartilage defect model. Twelve full-thickness 15-mm cartilage lesions in the femoropatellar articulations of six young mature horses were repaired by an injection of autogenous fibrin containing 25 microg of human recombinant insulin-like growth factor-I or, in control joints, fibrin without the growth factor. All horses were killed at 6 months, and cartilage repair tissue and surrounding cartilage were assessed by histology, histochemistry, types I and II collagen immunohistochemistry, types I and II collagen in situ hybridization, and matrix biochemical determinations. White tissue filled grafted and control lesions, with the growth factor-treated defects being more completely filled and securely attached to the subchondral bone. A moderately improved chondrocyte population, more columnar cellular organization, and better attachment to the underlying bone were evident on histological evaluation of growth factor-treated defects. Type-II procollagen mRNA was abundantly present in the deeper half of the treated sections compared with moderate message expression in control tissues. Immunolocalization of type-II collagen showed a preponderance of the collagen in growth factor-treated lesions, confirming translation of type-II message to protein. Composite histologic healing scores for treated defects were significantly improved over those for control defects. DNA content in the cartilage defects was similar in treated and control joints. Matrix proteoglycan content was similar in treated and control defects and lower in the defects than in the intact surrounding and remote cartilage of the treated and control joints. The proportion of type-II collagen significantly increased in growth factor-treated tissues. Fibrin polymers laden with insulin-like growth factor-I improved the histologic appearance and the proportion of type-II collagen in healing, full-thickness cartilage lesions.

The aim of this study was to develop a new bi-layered scaffold for osteochondral tissue regeneration through a ""biomimetic"" and ""bioinspired"" approach. For chondral regeneration, the scaffold was realized with an organic compound (type I collagen), while for the regeneration of the subchondral layer, bioactive magnesium-doped hydroxyapatite (Mg/HA) crystals were co-precipitated with the organic component of the scaffold. The entire scaffold structure was stabilized with a cross-linking agent, highly reactive bis-epoxyde (1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether - BDDGE 1wt%). The developed scaffold was then characterized for its physico-chemical characteristics. Its structure and adhesion strength between the integrated layers were investigated. At the same time, in vitro cell culture studies were carried out to examine the ability of chondral and bone scaffold layers to separately support adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into chondrocytes and osteoblasts, respectively. Moreover, an in vivo study with nude mice, transplanted with osteochondral scaffolds plain or engineered with undifferentiated hMSCs, was also set up with 4 and 8-week time points. The results showed that chondral and bone scaffold layers represented biocompatible scaffolds able to sustain hMSCs attachment and proliferation. Moreover, the association of scaffold stimuli and differentiation medium, induced hMSCs chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). The ectopic implantation of the engineered osteochondral scaffolds indicated that hMSCs were able to colonize the osteochondral scaffold in depth. The scaffold appeared permissive to tissue growth and penetration, ensuring the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen, as also suggested by the presence of a neo-angiogenesis process, especially at 4weeks. Moreover, the in vivo results further confirmed the great potential of the scaffold in tissue engineering, as it was able to support the initial formation of new bone and chondral tissue, confirming the importance of combined and innovative strategies to improve the available therapeutic strategies for chondral and osteochondral regeneration.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

To mitigate the effects of dedifferentiation, this study employed a post-expansion aggregate culture step to enhance the chondrogenic phenotype of passaged articular chondrocytes (ACs) before their integration into self-assembled neocartilage constructs. The objective was twofold: (1) to explore how passage number (P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7), with or without aggregate culture, affected construct properties; and (2) to determine the highest passage number that could form neocartilage with functional properties. Juvenile leporine ACs were passaged to P2-P7, with or without aggregate culture, and self-assembled into 5mm discs in non-adhesive agarose molds without using any exogenous scaffolds. Construct biochemical and biomechanical properties were assessed. With aggregate culture, neocartilage constructs had significantly higher collagen content, higher tensile properties, and flatter morphologies. These beneficial effects were most obvious at higher passage numbers. Specifically, collagen content, Young's modulus, and instantaneous compressive modulus in the P7, aggregate group were 53%, 116%, and 178% higher than those in the P7, non-aggregate group. Most interestingly, these extensively passaged P7 ACs (expansion factor of 85,000), which are typically highly dedifferentiated, were able to form constructs with properties similar to or higher than those formed by lower passage number cells. This study not only demonstrated that post-expansion aggregate culture could significantly improve the properties of self-assembled neocartilage, but also that chondrocytes of exceedingly high passage numbers, expanded using the methods in this study, could be used in cartilage engineering applications.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0
21802135,The use of de-differentiated chondrocytes delivered by a heparin-based hydrogel to regenerate cartilage in partial-thickness defects.,"Mihye Kim, Se Eun Kim, Seong Soo Kang, Young Ha Kim, Giyoong Tae","Partial-thickness cartilage defects, with no subchondral bone injury, do not repair spontaneously, thus there is no clinically effective treatment for these lesions. Although the autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) is one of the promising approaches for cartilage repair, it requires in vitro cell expansion to get sufficient cells, but chondrocytes lose their chondrogenic phenotype during expansion by monolayer culture, leading to de-differentiation. In this study, a heparin-based hydrogel was evaluated and optimized to induce cartilage regeneration with de-differentiated chondrocytes. First, re-differentiation of de-differentiated chondrocytes encapsulated in heparin-based hydrogels was characterized in vitro with various polymer concentrations (from 3 to 20 wt.%). Even under a normal cell culture condition (no growth factors or chondrogenic components), efficient re-differentiation of cells was observed with the optimum at 10 wt.% hydrogel, showing the complete re-differentiation within a week. Efficient re-differentiation and cartilage formation of de-differentiated cell/hydrogel construct were also confirmed in vivo by subcutaneous implantation on the back of nude mice. Finally, excellent cartilage regeneration and good integration with surrounding, similar to natural cartilage, was also observed by delivering de-differentiated chondrocytes using the heparin-based hydrogel in partial-thickness defects of rabbit knees whereas no healing was observed for the control defects. These results demonstrate that the heparin-based hydrogel is very efficient for re-differentiation of expanded chondrocytes and cartilage regeneration without using any exogenous inducing factors, thus it could serve as an injectable cell-carrier and scaffold for cartilage repair. Excellent chondrogenic nature of the heparin-based hydrogel might be associated with the hydrogel characteristic that can secure endogenous growth factors secreted from chondrocytes, which then can promote the chondrogenesis, as suggested by the detection of TGF-β1 in both in vitro and in vivo cell/hydrogel constructs.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Four osteochondral defects in each animal were created at non-weightbearing areas of knee joints (2/each side) and were respectively repaired by a chondrogenically induced BMSC-PGA/PLA construct in experimental group (Exp), by a dexamethasone-treated BMSC-PGA/PLA construct in control 1 group (Ctrl 1), by a PGA/PLA construct alone in control 2 group (Ctrl 2), or left unrepaired in control 3 group (Ctrl 3). To trace the implanted cells, green fluorescent protein (GFP)- labeled BMSCs were implanted in 2 animals. Gross view and histology showed that Exp and Ctrl 1 (with cell implantation) achieved better reparative results than Ctrl 2 and Ctrl 3 (without cell implantation) in terms of the reparative level and the restoration of the histological structure. In addition, 6-month results were better than 3-month results in all 4 groups. In Exp, 11 of 16 defects were completely repaired by hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone. In Ctrl 1, 11 of 16 defects were repaired by fibrocartilage and cancellous bone, although the repair with hyaline cartilage and cancellous bone was observed in 5 of 16 defects. In contrast, no obvious repair or only fibrotic tissue was observed in Ctrl 2 and Ctrl 3. The compressive moduli of repaired cartilage in Exp reached 80.27% of the normal amount at 6 months, with a high level of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content (no statistical difference from normal). In Ctrl 1, the compressive moduli and GAG content were 62.69% and 78.03% of normal levels, respectively. More importantly, GFP-labeled cells were detected in the engineered cartilage and the repaired subchondral bone. These results strongly indicate that the implanted BMSCs can differentiate into either chondrocytes or osteoblasts and repair articular osteochondral defects by forming engineered cartilage and engineered bone.",2006,Jeyaraman_2020,0
25504882,Protein-releasing polymeric scaffolds induce fibrochondrocytic differentiation of endogenous cells for knee meniscus regeneration in sheep.,"Chang H Lee, Scott A Rodeo, Lisa Ann Fortier, Chuanyong Lu, Cevat Erisken, Jeremy J Mao","Regeneration of complex tissues, such as kidney, liver, and cartilage, continues to be a scientific and translational challenge. Survival of ex vivo cultured, transplanted cells in tissue grafts is among one of the key barriers. Meniscus is a complex tissue consisting of collagen fibers and proteoglycans with gradient phenotypes of fibrocartilage and functions to provide congruence of the knee joint, without which the patient is likely to develop arthritis. Endogenous stem/progenitor cells regenerated the knee meniscus upon spatially released human connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGFβ3) from a three-dimensional (3D)-printed biomaterial, enabling functional knee recovery. Sequentially applied CTGF and TGFβ3 were necessary and sufficient to propel mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells, as a heterogeneous population or as single-cell progenies, into fibrochondrocytes that concurrently synthesized procollagens I and IIα. When released from microchannels of 3D-printed, human meniscus scaffolds, CTGF and TGFβ3 induced endogenous stem/progenitor cells to differentiate and synthesize zone-specific type I and II collagens. We then replaced sheep meniscus with anatomically correct, 3D-printed scaffolds that incorporated spatially delivered CTGF and TGFβ3. Endogenous cells regenerated the meniscus with zone-specific matrix phenotypes: primarily type I collagen in the outer zone, and type II collagen in the inner zone, reminiscent of the native meniscus. Spatiotemporally delivered CTGF and TGFβ3 also restored inhomogeneous mechanical properties in the regenerated sheep meniscus. Survival and directed differentiation of endogenous cells in a tissue defect may have implications in the regeneration of complex (heterogeneous) tissues and organs.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The present study attempted to combine the advantages of porous scaffold and hydrogel in delivering chondrocytes to partial-thickness cartilage defects. An electrospun, gelatin-incorporated PLCL scaffold mechanically similar to natural cartilage was fabricated, and chondrocytes were seeded using an injectable heparin-based hydrogel for efficient cell seeding. The scaffold/hydrogel composite showed more enhanced expression of chondrogenic genes and production of GAGs than those prepared without hydrogel. In addition, significant cartilage formation showing good integration with surrounding, similar to natural cartilage, was observed by scaffold/hydrogel composite system in partial-thickness defects of rabbit knees while no regeneration was observed in control defects. Although no exogenous chondrogenic factors were added, it was evident that the scaffold/hydrogel composite system was highly effective and better than the scaffold alone system without hydrogel for cartilage regeneration both in vitro and in vivo.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Cartilage has a tissue-specific architecture, complicating recreation by synthetic biomaterials. A novel approach for reconstruction is the use of devitalised cartilage. Treatment with high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) achieves devitalisation while biomechanical properties are remained. Therefore, in the present study, cartilage was devitalised using HHP treatment and the potential for revitalisation with chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was investigated. The devitalisation of cartilage was performed by application of 480 MPa over 10 minutes. Effective cellular inactivation was demonstrated by the trypan blue exclusion test and DNA quantification. Histology and electron microscopy examinations showed undamaged cartilage structure after HHP treatment. For revitalisation chondrocytes and MSCs were cultured on devitalised cartilage without supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors. Both chondrocytes and MSCs significantly increased expression of cartilage-specific genes. ECM stainings showed neocartilage-like structure with positive AZAN staining as well as collagen type II and aggrecan deposition after three weeks of cultivation. Our results showed that HHP treatment caused devitalisation of cartilage tissue. ECM proteins were not influenced, thus, providing a scaffold for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and chondrocytes. Therefore, using HHP-treated tissue might be a promising approach for cartilage repair.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

We present the short-term clinical outcome and MRI findings of a cell-free scaffold used for the treatment of these lesions in the knee. A total of 38 patients were prospectively evaluated clinically for two years following treatment with an osteochondral nanostructured biomimetic scaffold. There were 23 men and 15 women; the mean age of the patients was 30.5 years (15 to 64). Clinical outcome was assessed using the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Tegner activity scale and a Visual Analgue scale for pain. MRI data were analysed based on the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring system at three, 12 and 24 months post-operatively. There was a continuous significant clinical improvement after surgery. In two patients, the scaffold treatment failed (5.3%) There was a statistically significant improvement in the MOCART precentage scores. The repair tissue filled most of the defect sufficiently. We found subchondral laminar changes in all patients. Intralesional osteophytes were found in two patients (5.3%). We conclude that this one-step scaffold-based technique can be used for osteochondral repair. The surgical technique is straightforward, and the clinical results are promising. The MRI aspects of the repair tissue continue to evolve during the first two years after surgery. However, the subchondral laminar and bone changes are a concern.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Alginate served as a temporary supportive matrix component and was removed prior to transplantation. The defects were analyzed macroscopically, histologically, and electron microscopically, and evaluated with a semi-quantitative score system. Periosteal cell transplants showed a chondrogenic differentiation, which results in the development of embryonic-like cartilage tissue after 4 weeks and complete resurfacing of the patellar groove after 12 weeks. In the control groups, no repair was observed. Under the influence of TGF-beta1 we observed a reduction of the cartilage layer, whereas the osteochondral integration and the zonal architecture were improved. Periosteal cell-beads are stable cartilage transplants and have stiffness and elasticity enough for easy and sufficient transplant fixation.

A strong correlation exists between the amount and location of the resected meniscus and the development of degenerative changes in the knee. On the other hand, osteoarthritic changes of the joint alter the structural and functional integrity of meniscal tissue. These alterations might additionally compromise the limited healing capacity of the meniscus. In young, active patients without cartilage damage, meniscus therapy including partial meniscectomy, meniscus suture, and meniscus replacement has proven beneficial effects in long-term studies. Even in an early osteoarthritic milieu, there is a relevant regenerative potential of the meniscus and the surrounding cartilage.

Conservative measures such as injection and physical therapy can provide short-term pain relief but are only palliative in nature. Joint replacement, a successful procedure in the older population, is controversial in younger patients, who are less satisfied and experience higher failure rates. Therefore, while traditionally not indicated for the treatment of OA, cartilage repair has become a focus of increased interest due to its potential to provide pain relief and alter the progression of degenerative disease, with the hope of delaying or obviating the need for joint replacement. The field of cartilage repair is seeing the rapid development of new technologies that promise greater ease of application, less demanding rehabilitation and better outcomes.

22261870,"Cartilage damage in the haemophilic joints: pathophysiology, diagnosis and management.",E Carlos Rodriguez-Merchan,"Intra-articular bleeding affects the metabolism and repair of articular cartilage. Biomechanical data have shown that blood causes harmful effects on overall cartilage function under loading conditions. Therefore, haemophilic patients suffering a haemarthrosis should be subjected to blood aspiration (arthrocentesis) to prevent cartilage damage. MRI and ultrasonography have shown themselves to be excellent noninvasive tools for the evaluation of early cartilage damage that remains undetectable by conventional radiography in haemophilic patients. Prophylaxis with the deficient factor can prevent cartilage deterioration and reduce the incidence of joint haemorrhage in children with haemophilia. Radiosynovectomy has proved to be a highly effective procedure to decrease both the frequency and the severity of recurrent intra-articular bleeding episodes. Nowadays, the most usual surgical procedures for treating articular cartilage defects (cartilage repair) include abrasion chondroplasty, microfracture, mosaicplasty, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and matrix-induced ACI. In small defects (<2-4 cm(2)), ostechondral autograft or microfracture are the recommended options. In large defects (>2-4 cm(2)), ACI or osteochondral allograft are indicated. However, these techniques have not been applied in haemophilic patients because inflammatory conditions and advanced degenerative change (>50% joint space narrowing) are contraindications for cartilage repair. Thus, prevention of cartilage damage is paramount in haemophilia. The definitive remedy for advanced cartilage damage is either (knee or hip) replacement or (ankle) arthrodesis. Primary prophylaxis and radiosynovectomy are the best alternatives at our disposal to protect our patients against cartilage damage and arthropathy in haemophilic joints.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

However, the inability to target MSCs in tissues of interest with high efficiency and engraftment has become a significant barrier for MSC-based therapies. The mobilization and transfer of MSCs to defective/damaged sites in tissues or organs in vivo with high efficacy and efficiency has been a major concern. In the present study, we identified a peptide sequence (E7) with seven amino acids through phage display technology, which has a high specific affinity to bone marrow-derived MSCs. Subsequent analysis suggested that the peptide could efﬁciently interact speciﬁcally with MSCs without any species specificity. Thereafter, E7 was covalently conjugated onto polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun meshes to construct an ""MSC-homing device"" for the recruitment of MSCs both in vitro and in vivo. The E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes were implanted into a cartilage defect site of rat knee joints, combined with a microfracture procedure to mobilize the endogenous MSCs. After 7 d of implantation, immunofluorescence staining showed that the cells grown into the E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes yielded a high positive rate for specific MSC surface markers (CD44, CD90, and CD105) compared with those in arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes (63.67% vs. 3.03%; 59.37% vs. 2.98%; and 61.45% vs. 3.82%, respectively). Furthermore, the percentage of CD68 positive cells in the E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes was much lower than that in the RGD-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes (5.57% vs. 53.43%). This result indicates that E7-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes absorb much less inflammatory cells in vivo than RGD-conjugated PCL electrospun meshes. The results of the present study suggest that the identified E7 peptide sequence has a high specific affinity to MSCs. Covalently conjugating this peptide on the synthetic PCL mesh significantly enhanced the MSC recruitment of PCL in vivo.

22293769,Evaluation and management of osteochondral lesions of the knee.,"Y Julia Kao, Julianne Ho, Christina R Allen","Osteochondral lesions of the knee is a common disorder in adolescents, although it may present in children and adults. Despite the fact that the disorder was discovered more than a century ago, no specific causes have been identified, although relationships with ischemia, irregular ossification of epiphyseal cartilage, genetic influences, trauma, and endocrine disorders have been postulated. Taking a thorough history and performing a thorough physical examination will facilitate diagnosis of this condition. Radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging are useful diagnostic tools that aid in the evaluation. A comprehensive knowledge of the relevant anatomy and clinical progression of osteochondral lesions allows for a better understanding of the classification systems and, ultimately management of this disorder. The size, location, and stability of the lesion, as well as the patient's age, are crucial in determining optimal treatment. The spectrum of injury ranges from small, stable lesions, which can be treated nonoperatively, to unstable or displaced lesions, which may require surgical management. Surgical options include drilling of subchondral bone, curettage and microfracture, refixation of detached lesions, autologous osteochondral autograft procedures (eg, mosaicplasty, osteochondral autograft transfer system), autologous chondrocyte implantation, and osteochondral allograft resurfacing.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early functional outcome and activity level after 2-stage autologous chondrocyte implantation in professional soldiers and athletes. Nineteen patients with an average age of 32.2 years were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation and followed up for a minimum of 2 years. All patients except 2 had received previous arthroscopic treatment with debridement and/or microfracture. The mean size of the postdebridement defect was 6.54 cm2. Using Novocart technology (B. Braun-Tetec, Reutlingen, Germany), periosteal patch and matrix-assisted autologous chondrocyte implantation was sequentially performed with no randomization. The average subjective knee evaluation score and Lysholm score improved from 39.16 and 42.42, respectively, preoperatively to 62.4 and 69.4, respectively, at latest follow-up.

Chondral lesions can be caused by metabolic stimulation, or by genetic, vascular and traumatic events, and are classified according to the size and thickness of the affected cartilage. Clinical diagnosis can be difficult, especially due to insidious symptoms. Additional tests, as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), may be needed. The treatment of these lesions usually starts with non-operative management. Surgery should be reserved for patients with detached chondral fragments, blocked range of motion, or the failure of non-operative treatment. The surgical techniques used for the treatment of partial thickness defects are Debridement and Ablation. These techniques aim to improve symptoms, since they do not restore normal structure and function of the cartilage. For full-thickness defects (osteochondral lesion), available treatments are Abrasion, Drilling, Microfracture, Osteochondral Autologous and Allogeneic Transplantation, and biological techniques such as the use of Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation, Minced Cartilage and stem cells.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

However, to regenerate articular cartilage using this method, the procedure paradoxically demands that the cell source of the articular chondrocytes (ACs) for ex vivo expansion be from the patient's own healthy cartilage, which can result in donor site morbidity. Accordingly, it is essential to develop a substitute for AC. In the present study, we investigated whether synovium-derived cells (SYs) could be used as a partial replacement for ACs in ACI. ACs and SYs from the knees of rabbits were isolated and cultured, and the growth rates of the cells were compared. To manufacture the cellular transplants, we developed a high-density suspension-shaking culture method (HDSS), which circulates the cells in culture media, promoting self-assembly of scaffold-free cellular aggregates. ACs and SYs were mixed in various ratios using HDSS. Injectable cellular transplants were harvested and transplanted into full-thickness osteochondral defects. Simultaneously, histological evaluations were conducted with toluidine blue and safranin O, and immunohistochemistry of collagen type I and II was conducted. Gene expression to evaluate chondrocyte-specific differentiation was also performed. We successfully prepared a large quantity of spheroids (spheroidal cell aggregates) in a short time using mixed ACs and SYs, for all cellular composition ratios. Our data showed that the minimal therapeutic unit for the transplants contributed to in situ regeneration of cartilage. In summary, SYs can be used as a replacement for ACs in clinical cases of ACI in patients with broad areas of osteoarthritic lesions.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0

21669155,The manangement of knee cartilage defects with modified amic technique: preliminary results.,"A Schiavone Panni, S Cerciello, M Vasso","Cartilage defects represent a common problem in orthopaedic practice. The knee is frequently involved and the medial femoral condyle is the most common localization. Predisposing factors are: traumas, inflammatory conditions and biomechanics alterations. Several surgical options are available once correct diagnosis is given and accurate patient evaluation has been performed. The aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate functional results of modified autologous matrix induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) technique in a population of patients affected by focal cartilage defects A population of 17 patients was enrolled in this study. 10 patients were male, mean age at the time of surgery was 39 years, right side was involved in 11 cases. All patients were evaluated with accurate physical exam and complete imaging study. At an average FU of 36 months, mean IKDC score and Lysholm score improved from 32 to 82 and from 38 to 74. 13 patients out of 17 (76.5%) were satisfied or extremely satisfied with their functional result. MRI control showed reduction of the defect area and subchondral oedema in 10 cases (58.8%). AMIC technique is a relatively new option in the treatment of full thickness cartilage lesions. It enhances the advantages of microfractures since the Chondrogide membrane protects and stabilizes the blood plug acting as a matrix for new cartilage formation. First reports on AMIC technique, show comparable results to autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) with the advantage of a single stage technique and no donor site morbidity. AMIC technique represents a new option in the treatment of full thickness cartilage defect. It is safe and reliable. Our data are in accordance with previously reported series in literature and confirm the good objective and subjective results of this procedure.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0
21922270,[Repair of local cartilage defects in the patellofemoral joint].,"S Anders, P Lechler, J Grifka, J Schaumburger","Cartilage defects of the patellofemoral joint represent different entities. Results of patellofemoral cartilage repair are often variable. Concomitant pathologies, such as malalignment and instability are frequent. Currently no common treatment concept exists. Improvement of patellofemoral biomechanics, e.g. tubercle transfer, results in better outcome independent of the cartilage repair technique used. In patellofemoral instability reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) has recently become a focus of interest. Microfracturing and osteochondral cylinder transfer/mosaicplasty are recommended for smaller defects, while comparative studies have shown advantages for autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) in defects larger than 4 cm². In our study patients with patellofemoral scaffold ACI (MACI®), better Lysholm scores were seen with isolated trochlea defects rather than patella defects or bipolar lesions. While trochlea defects can be effectively addressed, treatment of bipolar patellofemoral defects by scaffold ACI cannot generally be recommended. Follow-up treatment of the patellofemoral joint is more time and cost-consuming than other defect localizations. For the development of therapeutic algorithms further well-defined large randomized studies are necessary.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0
21902141,Mosaïcplasty.,"Semon Bader, Anthony Miniaci","Management of the patient with symptomatic full-thickness chondral or osteochondral defects of the knee presents a challenging problem for the orthopedic surgeon. The natural history of untreated lesions demonstrates progressive degenerative changes and deterioration in functional outcome scores. Medical management, osteotomies, lavage, and debridement procedures temporize symptoms and slow progression. Cartilage restoration procedures such as microfracture and cell-based therapies have shown promise, but there are concerns of the long-term durability of these procedures in the active population. Mosaicplasty allows for restoration of articular defects with hyaline cartilage, and has shown excellent durability. Articular defect should measure between 1 to 4 cm(2) in diameter and extend 10 mm into subchondral bone. Mosaicplasty can be challenging when attempted arthroscopically, and the threshold to convert to an open procedure should be low when adequate visualization is not achieved. Use of variable graft size maximizes defect fill with hyaline cartilage. Avoidance of graft prominence >1 mm and attention to the contour of the joint optimizes the recreation of articular surface. This is achieved by placing central grafts in a large defect slightly prouder to obtain a convex shape to the articular surface. With attention to the nuances of the surgical technique, mosaicplasty offers an excellent option for cartilage restoration in the young active patient.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Oxidative stress is considered one of the pathophysiological factors in the progression of OA. We investigated the effects of grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), which is an antioxidant, on monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced arthritis of the knee joint of rat, which is an animal model of human OA. GSPE (100 mg/kg or 300 mg/kg) or saline was given orally three times per week for 4 weeks after the MIA injection. Pain was measured using the paw withdrawal latency (PWL), the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and the hind limb weight bearing ability. Joint damage was assessed using histological and microscopic analysis and microcomputerized tomography. Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13) and nitrotyrosine were detected using immunohistochemistry. Administration of GSPE to the MIA-treated rats significantly increased the PWL and PWT and this resulted in recovery of hind paw weight distribution (P < 0.05). GSPE reduced the loss of chondrocytes and proteoglycan, the production of MMP13, nitrotyrosine and IL-1β and the formation of osteophytes, and it reduced the number of subchondral bone fractures in the MIA-treated rats. These results indicate that GSPE is antinociceptive and it is protective against joint damage in the MIA-treated rat model of OA. GSPE could open up novel avenues for the treatment of OA.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Thus, the authors thought that ""how can this indication regarding age be extended?,"" and tried to find a way to use this technique effectively over 40 years of age. The aim of this study was the first to report the results regarding the PRP as an adjunct for arthroscopic microfracture in the early osteoarthritic (OA) knee with cartilage lesion over 40 years of age. 49 patients who underwent arthroscopic microfracture for cartilage lesion sized less than 4 cm(2) with early OA, aged 40-50 years, were enrolled and randomly divided into 2 groups: a control group with only arthroscopic microfracture (25 patients) and a study group with arthroscopic microfracture and PRP (24 patients). The patients were prospectively evaluated with VAS, IKDC score at preoperative and postoperative 1, 6, 12, and 24 months.

There were significant improvements in clinical results between preoperative evaluation and postoperative 2 years in both groups (p = 0.017). In the postoperative 2 years, clinical results showed significantly better in the study group than in the control group (p = 0.012). In post-arthroscopic finding, hardness and elasticity degree was better in the study group.

Despite multiple plausible mechanisms of action and a plethora of positive in vivo animal studies, few randomised controlled clinical trials have demonstrated meaningful clinical benefit in any condition so far. This could be due to confusion in cell product terminology, complexity of clinical study design and execution or agreement on meaningful outcome measures. It could also indicate that MSC as currently employed are ineffective. Within the rheumatic diseases, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) have received most attention. Uncontrolled multiple trial data from over 300 SLE patients have been published from one centre suggesting a positive outcome; one single centre comparative study in 172 RA was positive and no human studies have compared intra-articular MSC therapy to non-MSC techniques for osteoarthritis in the absence of surgery.

The purpose of the study was to underline the accessability of the acetabulum and the femoral head through the known portals and prove i) the feasibility of placing the AMIC in the different zones of the hip joint and ii) check for dislocation after joint movement. Six human cadavers underwent hip arthroscopy on both hips. Two chondral lesions were set on each femoral head and two in the acetabulum to evaluate a total of 48 defects. After microfracturing an autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis graft was placed on these lesions arthroscopically. After repeated joint movement the dislocation of the graft was checked. It was possible to place the AMIC graft in all 48 chondral lesions. The time needed for placing the graft was 8±2.9 minutes. A trend of time reduction could be detected throughout this study as the surgeon gained more experience. For the femoral head, after twenty cycles of joint movement 18/24 spots showed no displacement, 4/24 showed minor displacement (<3 mm) and 2/24 showed major displacement (>3 mm). None showed total displacement. For the acetabulum 22/24 spots showed no displacement and 2/24 showed minor displacement.

Surgical treatment paradigms aim to restore the articular surface with a repair tissue similar to native cartilage and to provide long-term symptomatic relief.➤ Arthroscopic bone-marrow stimulation techniques, such as microfracture and drilling, perforate the subchondral plate with multiple openings to recruit mesenchymal stem cells from the underlying bone marrow to stimulate the differentiation of fibrocartilaginous repair tissue in the defect site. The ability of fibrocartilage to withstand mechanical loading and protect the subchondral bone over time is a concern.➤ Autologous osteochondral transplantation techniques replace the defect with a tubular unit of viable hyaline cartilage and bone from a donor site in the ipsilateral knee. In rare cases, a graft can also be harvested from the ipsilateral talus or contralateral knee. The limitations of donor site morbidity and the potential need for an osteotomy about the ankle should be considered. Some anterior or far posterior talar lesions can be accessed without arthrotomy or with a plafondplasty.➤ Osteochondral allograft transplantation allows an osteochondral lesion with a large surface area to be replaced with a single unit of viable articular cartilage and subchondral bone from a donor that is matched to size, shape, and surface curvature. The best available evidence suggests that this procedure should be limited to large-volume cystic lesions or salvage procedures.➤ Autologous chondrocyte implantation techniques require a two-stage procedure, the first for chondrocyte harvest and the second for implantation in a periosteum-covered or matrix-induced form after in vivo culture expansion. Theoretically, the transplantation of chondrocyte-like cells into the defect will result in hyaline-like repair tissue.",2013,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The better understanding of interactions of articular cartilage and subchondral bone in recent years led to increased attention to restoration of the entire osteochondral unit. In comparison to chondral lesions the regeneration of osteochondral defects is much more complex and a far greater surgical and therapeutic challenge. The damaged tissue does not only include the superficial cartilage layer but also the subchondral bone. For deep, osteochondral damage, as it occurs for example with osteochondrosis dissecans, the full thickness of the defect needs to be replaced to restore the joint surface (1). Eligible therapeutic procedures have to consider these two different tissues with their different intrinsic healing potential (2). In the last decades, several surgical treatment options have emerged and have already been clinically established (3-6). Autologous or allogeneic osteochondral transplants consist of articular cartilage and subchondral bone and allow the replacement of the entire osteochondral unit. The defects are filled with cylindrical osteochondral grafts that aim to provide a congruent hyaline cartilage covered surface (3,7,8). Disadvantages are the limited amount of available grafts, donor site morbidity (for autologous transplants) and the incongruence of the surface; thereby the application of this method is especially limited for large defects. New approaches in the field of tissue engineering opened up promising possibilities for regenerative osteochondral therapy. The implantation of autologous chondrocytes marked the first cell based biological approach for the treatment of full-thickness cartilage lesions and is now worldwide established with good clinical results even 10 to 20 years after implantation (9,10). However, to date, this technique is not suitable for the treatment of all types of lesions such as deep defects involving the subchondral bone (11). The sandwich-technique combines bone grafting with current approaches in Tissue Engineering (5,6). This combination seems to be able to overcome the limitations seen in osteochondral grafts alone. After autologous bone grafting to the subchondral defect area, a membrane seeded with autologous chondrocytes is sutured above and facilitates to match the topology of the graft with the injured site. Of course, the previous bone reconstruction needs additional surgical time and often even an additional surgery. Moreover, to date, long-term data is missing (12). Tissue Engineering without additional bone grafting aims to restore the complex structure and properties of native articular cartilage by chondrogenic and osteogenic potential of the transplanted cells. However, again, it is usually only the cartilage tissue that is more or less regenerated. Additional osteochondral damage needs a specific further treatment. In order to achieve a regeneration of the multilayered structure of osteochondral defects, three-dimensional tissue engineered products seeded with autologous/allogeneic cells might provide a good regeneration capacity (11). Beside autologous chondrocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seem to be an attractive alternative for the development of a full-thickness cartilage tissue. In numerous preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, mesenchymal stem cells have displayed excellent tissue regeneration potential (13,14). The important advantage of mesenchymal stem cells especially for the treatment of osteochondral defects is that they have the capacity to differentiate in osteocytes as well as chondrocytes. Therefore, they potentially allow a multilayered regeneration of the defect. In recent years, several scaffolds with osteochondral regenerative potential have therefore been developed and evaluated with promising preliminary results (1,15-18). Furthermore, fibrin glue as a cell carrier became one of the preferred techniques in experimental cartilage repair and has already successfully been used in several animal studies (19-21) and even first human trials (22). The following protocol will demonstrate an experimental technique for isolating mesenchymal stem cells from a rabbit's bone marrow, for subsequent proliferation in cell culture and for preparing a standardized in vitro-model for fibrin-cell-clots. Finally, a technique for the implantation of pre-established fibrin-cell-clots into artificial osteochondral defects of the rabbit's knee joint will be described.",2013,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In the athlete, untreated articular cartilage defects can represent a career threatening injury and create a significant obstacle in returning to full athletic participation. The markedly limited healing potential of articular cartilage often leads to continued deterioration and progressive functional limitations. Numerous studies have shown that full thickness articular cartilage lesions are frequently encountered at the time of arthroscopy, particularly associated with athletic injury. A variety of surgical treatment options exist, including debridement, microfracture, osteochondral autograft, osteochondral allograft, and autologous chondrocyte implantation.

Rising health awareness, increasingly active populations and improvements in medical techniques have increased the application of cartilage regenerative minimally invasive approaches for glenohumeral joint preservation or delayed prosthetic replacement. In contrast to the conclusive and mostly convincing mid-term results of cartilage regenerative techniques known for the knee, clinical results of innovative therapeutic approaches with glenohumeral cartilage defects are more or less absent. Current techniques include procedures for mesenchymal stem cell recruitment, such as microfracturing, (autologous) osteochondral transplantation, (matrix-associated) autologous chondrocyte transplantation and biological resurfacing, addressing focal chondral defects up to massive structural osteochondral defects.

Another indication for ACT are cartilage defects for which previous operative measures have failed. Osteoarthritis and kissing lesions are contraindications. Axial malalignment and knee joint instability need to be corrected. Second-generation ACT procedures are based on three-dimensional biomaterials in which the articular chondrocytes are seeded prior to implantation.

However, the regenerated cartilage after microfracture surgery clearly differs from normal articular cartilage. This suggests that the clinical outcome of patients undergoing microfracture therapy could be improved. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) is known to protect against articular cartilage loss. Therefore, in an effort to achieve cartilage regeneration of high efficacy, we manufactured a DHEA-S-releasing rod-type implant for implantation into the holes produced by microfracture surgery. The polymeric rod-type implant was made of biodegradable poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) and beta-tricalcium phosphate to enable controlled release of DHEA-S. The implant was dip-coated with a dilute PLGA solution to prevent the burst release of DHEA-S. The rod-type implant was sufficiently stiff to permit implantation into the holes made by microfracture. DHEA-S was released from the implant for more than four weeks. Furthermore, eight weeks after implantation into rabbit knees, the implants dramatically enhanced cartilage regeneration compared to control. Moreover, the degradation of the implant over the eight weeks from implantation into the knee did not induce any adverse effects. Therefore, this polymeric rod-type implant does not only provide an improvement in microfracture surgery, but also has great potential as a new formulation for drug delivery.",2008,Jeyaraman_2020,0
18313471,Autologous chondrocyte implantation--technique and long-term follow-up.,Mats Brittberg,"Cartilage has a limited capacity for self repair after injury. This biological deficiency has led to a variety of surgical attempts to improve the repair of injured articular cartilage surfaces over the past 50 years. The first example of clinical cartilage tissue engineering was performed in 1987 when a knee with an articular cartilage defect on the femoral condyle was treated by implanting the patient's own chondrocytes that had been expanded in vitro into the defect in combination with a covering mechanical membrane-the periosteum. This technology is either termed autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Today, many modifications of the technique exist, from the first generation to now second and third generations of chondrocyte implantation.

18313469,Marrow stimulation techniques.,"M R Steinwachs, Th Guggi, P C Kreuz","Due to the very low intrinsic activity of human adult cartilage, healing of chondral and osteochondral defects in patients cannot be expected. In treating symptomatic cartilage damage, marrow stimulation methods belong to the most frequently used methods, along with autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) and mosaicplasty. These arthroscopic procedures are generally easy and the marrow stimulation treatment costs relatively little. In recent years, Pridie drilling has been increasingly replaced by the microfracture technique. This modification relies on the same biological principles of promoting resurfacing with the formation of fibro-cartilaginous repair tissue. For the treatment of smaller cartilage defects (<2.5 cm(2)), microfracture still remains the first choice for treatment. The clinical results after microfracture in the knee are age dependent. Younger and active patients (<40 years) with smaller isolated traumatic lesions on the femoral condyles have the best long-term results. The deterioration of the clinical results begins after 18 months and is significantly more pronounced in older patients with defects on the patella-femoral joint and tibia. The inferior quality of the repair tissue, partially incomplete defect filling and new bone formation in the defect area seem to be limitations of these methods. The AMIC (autologous matrix induced chondrogenesis) technique was developed to enable treatment of larger defects by the application of a collagen Type III/I membrane (Geistlich Pharma, Wolhusen, Switzerland), in particular when cell-engaged procedures such as ACT cannot be used for financial reasons or because it is not indicated. AMIC seems to be particularly suitable for treating damaged retropatellar cartilage, which is an advantage because these defects can be hard to treat with standard microfracturing alone. The results of the ongoing studies are awaited to establish whether better results with this technology are achievable in the long term.",2008,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Fractures, ligamentous lesions, and cartilaginous damage are often associated. Nevertheless the injury is often misjudged and concomitant chondral lesions are assessed late. In the case of a symptomatic osteocartilaginous lesion of the talus, which can be illustrated by MRI or X-ray, operative intervention is indicated. Methods such as microfracturing, mosaicplasty, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT) are in clinical use. The latter is well known and being established as the treatment of choice for large cartilage defects in the knee. Due to the good results in the knee and the technological improvements (three-dimensional tissue constructs seeded with autologous chondrocytes) this method is being increasingly applied for cartilage lesions of the talus. In contrast to the mosaicplasty donor site morbidity is low and the size of the defect is not a limiting factor. The current studies about ACT of the talus show a stable repair of the defect with mostly hyaline-like cartilage and high patient satisfaction.

Chondral defects, 7 mm in diameter, were created in both femoral medial condyles of five ewes. One defect was treated with the new technique while the contralateral knee was treated with microfracture alone. The results revealed that the quantity of repair tissue was significantly greater in the defects treated with the new system. The second study had two time points, 3 and 6 months, and used 13 ewes. In this study, both defects were treated with the new technique but one received additional subchondral drilling in order to stimulate extra tissue growth. The majority of the implants had good tissue induction, filling 50-100 per cent of the defect volume, while the compressive modulus of the repairs was in the range of 40-70 per cent of that for the surrounding cartilage.

Recently, both reparative and restorative procedures have been developed to address this significant source of morbidity in young active patients. Microfracture is a reparative technique that induces a healing response to occur in an area of articular cartilage damage. Osteochondral autografts and allografts in addition to autologous chondrocyte implantation are restorative techniques aimed at recreating a more normal articular surface.

We treated 5 patients, 3 who presented with painful traumatic chondral defects in the central weight-bearing portion of the tibial plateau (1 in the medial and 2 in the lateral compartment), and 2 who presented with painful chondral lesions on the distal tibia. An anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) drill guide positioned in the center of the defect was used to accurately prepare the cartilage surface, in one case arthroscopically and in 4 cases through an open incision. A guide-wire was introduced and drilled through the tibia, and a cannulated reamer equal to the diameter of the defect was advanced. An osteochondral cylinder was harvested from the non-weight-bearing zone of the femoral trochlea at the angle that corresponded to the angle on the ACL drill guide. The autograft was inserted in a retrograde fashion from the cortical window into the tibial tunnel to be flush with the articular surface in press-fit technique. The remaining tunnel defect between the cortical window on the tibia and the distal aspect of the autograft was filled with a cancellous bony cylinder and secured with a diagonal bioabsorbable screw. A concomitant varus deformity with the lesion on the medial tibial plateau was corrected in the same surgery using a high tibial osteotomy to relieve stress on the graft.

The current authors discuss the experimental background and their 8 years of clinical experience with the autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty. Several series of animal studies and subsequent clinical practice have confirmed the survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage. Hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage fill the donor sites located on the nonweightbearing surfaces and surfaces that bear less weight. Clinical scores, imaging techniques, control arthroscopies, histologic examination of biopsy samples, and cartilage stiffness measurements were used to evaluate the clinical outcomes and quality of the transplanted cartilage. According to these investigations, femoral condylar implantations have shown good to excellent results in 92%, tibial resurfacing in 88%, patellar and/or trochlear mosaicplasties in 81%, and talar procedures in 94% of patients. The Bandi score showed long-term donor site disturbances in 3% of patients. Fifty-eight of the 68 control arthroscopies had good gliding surfaces, histologically-proven survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage, and fibrocartilage covering of the donor sites. In the entire series, there were four deep infections and 34 painful hemarthroses after surgery. A multicentric, comparative, prospective evaluation of 413 arthroscopic resurfacing procedures (mosaicplasty, Pridie drilling, abrasion arthroplasty, and microfracture cases in homogenized subgroups) showed that mosaicplasty gave a more favorable clinical outcome in the long-term followup, than the other three techniques. Intermediate-term evaluation of the femoral condylar implantations (3-6-years followup) and talar mosaicplasties (3-7-years followup) confirmed the durability of the early results. From these encouraging results from an increasingly large series and similar results from other centers, it seems that autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty may be a viable alternative treatment of localized full-thickness cartilage damage of the weightbearing surfaces of the knee and other weightbearing synovial joints.",2001,Jeyaraman_2020,0
11572120,[Surgical therapeutic possibilities of cartilage damage].,"A C Burkart, P B Schoettle, A B Imhoff","Therapy of cartilage damage is a frequent problem, especially in the young and active patient. For the treatment of a cartilage damage we have to consider the size of the defect, age and weight of the patient, meniscal tears, ligament instabilities and varus-/valgus-malalignment. Lavage, shaving and debridement are only sufficient for a short time and have no long term effect. Abrasio and drilling could be useful in eldery people. Microfracturing seems to be an effective alternative for small defects. The restoration of the cartilage surface with the use of autologous chondrocyte transplantation, osteochondral autograft transplantation and posterior condyle transfer seems to be an adequate treatment for younger patients.",2001,Jeyaraman_2020,0
11398361,Treatment algorithm for osteochondral injuries of the knee.,"E L Cain, W G Clancy","The treatment of osteochondral fractures and OCD lesions in the knee is controversial. Many new procedures and techniques have been developed recently to address osteochondral lesions, indicating that no single procedure is accepted universally. Our treatment algorithm is based on the age of the patient, skeletal maturity, and the presence of adequate subchondral bone attached to the chondral lesion. Most nondisplaced lesions in the patient with open physes will heal with conservative treatment. The onset of skeletal maturity indicates a need for a more aggressive treatment approach. If adequate cortical bone is attached to the fragment, drilling of stable lesions, or drilling with fixation of unstable or loose fragments is appropriate. Autologous bone graft can be necessary to stimulate healing and properly reconstruct the subchondral bony contour. For failed fixation attempts or lesions not amenable to fixation, each treating surgeon must be proficient and comfortable with an articular surface reconstruction technique. The goal for the reconstructive procedure, to produce a smooth gliding articular surface of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage, is possible using current techniques including mosaicplasty, osteochondral allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation. Débridement, drilling, microfracture, and abrasion chondroplasty have been shown to result in fibrocartilage with inferior mechanical properties when compared with hyaline cartilage. No long-term studies have been published, however, to confirm the benefits of replacing osteochondral defects with hyaline cartilage rather than fibrocartilage. Although the results of many reconstructive procedures are quite encouraging with early follow up, the ultimate goal is to prevent long-term degenerative arthritis. Only well-designed prospective studies with long-term follow up will determine the adequacy of these procedures in reaching the ultimate goal. This treatment algorithm is based on the senior author's (WGC) experience with the complex dilemma of osteochondral lesions of the knee.",2001,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In 31 New Zealand White rabbits, a medial femoral condyle defect was created in each knee. After 4 weeks, 3 animals were killed for defect baseline values. In the other 28 rabbits, knees were sham-operated, treated with microfracturing, or treated by placing an oxidized zirconium (OxZr) or cobalt-chromium (CoCr) implant (theta articulating surface 3.5 mm; fixating pin of 9.1 mm length). These animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after treatment. Joints were evaluated macroscopically. Implant osseointegration was measured by automated histomorphometry, and cartilage repair was scored microscopically. Cartilage quality was analyzed macroscopically and microscopically. Bone-implant contact was 63.2% +/- 3.2% for CoCr and 62.5% +/- 3.2% for OxZr. Cartilage defects did not show complete healing, nor during subsequent sham-surgery or microfracturing. For all treatments, considerable cartilage damage in the articulating medial tibia, and degeneration of lateral tibial and femoral cartilage was observed (p < 0.05). Both CoCr and OxZr implant-treated defects showed an increase of cartilage degeneration compared to microfracturing and sham-operated defects (p < 0.05). Although only a single short-term follow-up period was investigated in this study, caution is warranted using small metal implants as a treatment for established localized cartilage defects because, even after 4 weeks in this model, the metal implants caused considerable degeneration of the articulating surface.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0
18635628,MR imaging of cartilage repair in the knee and ankle.,"Yun Sun Choi, Hollis G Potter, Tong Jin Chun","Because of the relative avascularity of articular cartilage, lesions that are caused by trauma or degeneration of the cartilage do not heal spontaneously and must be repaired surgically. The interventional procedures that have been developed for the repair of such lesions include abrasion, microfracture, autologous osteochondral transplantation, allograft transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. An accurate imaging assessment of the repair tissue is necessary in order to objectively evaluate the postoperative outcome. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and arthroscopy provide complementary information and are especially useful for follow-up evaluation of cartilage repair in the knee and ankle. Standard MR imaging techniques may be used postoperatively to evaluate the success of implantation and the state of cartilage healing. Newer matrix assessment techniques, which include delayed gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging and mapping of T1rho and T2 values, may provide useful supplemental information about the histologic and biochemical contents of reparative tissue. The normal postoperative appearance of the joints after cartilage repair varies according to the surgical technique used and the stage of healing. To identify potential complications, it is important to be familiar with the various repair procedures and the characteristic MR imaging features of the repair tissue at various postoperative intervals.",2008,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Symptomatic grade III/IV damage requires surgical treatment. There are special challenges involved in cartilage damage in the patellofemoral joint as the complicated biomechanics of the joint is often combined with dysplasia. All tissue regeneration measures are based on the recruitment of cells. The synovial cells available in the joint can be differentiated to fibrous cartilage under certain mechanical conditions; however, they cannot sufficiently fill in defects. Also the use of bone marrow cells for cartilage reconstruction only creates mechanically inferior fibrous cartilage (Pridie drillings, microfracture, AMIC). Presently only cultivated, autologous chondrocytes from the lab are available for a biomechanically high-quality reconstruction of the cartilage layer.The application of mesenchymal stem cells is a subject of extensive international research. However, the first experimental studies, after initial formation of cartilage, disappointingly show significant ossification.

In the last years many cell-based treatments have been proposed, in order to obtain good regeneration of cartilage defects. The Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis technique (AMIC(®)) combines the micro-fracture procedure with the use of a specific biological membrane. The phenotypic feature of bone marrow cell population, harvested from iliac crest and knee subchondral bone of patients treated with the AMIC(®) technique, enhanced by autologous concentrated bone marrow, was analysed to evaluate potential variations of the cell population. Samples of eleven patients, with isolated chondral lesions grade III or IV were treated with the AMIC(®) technique, enhanced by the use of autologous concentrated bone marrow. A small fraction of bone marrow samples, both from iliac crest and from the created micro-fractures, was analysed by FACS analysis and then cultured to verify their proliferative and differentiation potential. An average of 0.04% of concentrated bone marrow cells harvested from the iliac crest, presented mesenchymal stem cell phenotype (CD34(-)/CD45(low)/CD271(high)), whereas just 0.02% of these cells were identified from the samples harvested during the creation of micro-fractures at the knee. After two passages in culture, cells expressed a peculiar profile for MSC. Only MSC from bone marrow could be long-term propagated and were able to efficiently differentiate in the cultures.

Although the natural history of articular cartilage lesions has not been clearly studied, significant injuries are believed to progress, resulting in degenerative arthritis of the joint. Changes have been made in surgical techniques in an attempt to better manage these lesions, and a large industry has been built around arthroscopic and open surgical procedures for managing cartilage repair. However, there is limited evidence that any intervention significantly alters the natural history of these lesions. Randomized trials have been done to examine the outcomes of common restoration procedures performed in the United States today, such as microfracture, osteochondral autograft transfer, and autologous chondrocyte implantation.

20360528,Management of articular cartilage defects of the knee.,"Asheesh Bedi, Brian T Feeley, Riley J Williams","Articular cartilage has a poor intrinsic capacity for healing. The goal of surgical techniques to repair articular cartilage injuries is to achieve the regeneration of organized hyaline cartilage. Microfracture and other bone marrow stimulation techniques involve penetration of the subchondral plate in order to recruit mesenchymal stem cells into the chondral defect. The formation of a stable clot that fills the lesion is of paramount importance to achieve a successful outcome. Mosaicplasty is a viable option with which to address osteochondral lesions of the knee and offers the advantage of transplanting hyaline cartilage. However, limited graft availability and donor site morbidity are concerns. Transplantation of an osteochondral allograft consisting of intact, viable articular cartilage and its underlying subchondral bone offers the ability to address large osteochondral defects of the knee, including those involving an entire compartment. The primary theoretical advantage of autologous chondrocyte implantation is the development of hyaline-like cartilage rather than fibrocartilage in the defect, which presumably leads to better long-term outcomes and longevity of the healing tissue. Use of synthetic scaffolds is a potentially attractive alternative to traditional cartilage procedures as they are readily available and, unlike allogeneic tissue transplants, are associated with no risk of disease transmission.

Although many treatment options are currently available, none fulfills the criteria for an ideal repair solution, including a hyaline repair tissue that completely fills the defect and integrates well with the surrounding normal cartilage. The microfracture technique is an often-utilized, first-line treatment modality for chondral lesions within the knee, resulting in the formation of a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue with inferior biochemical and biomechanical properties compared to normal hyaline cartilage. Although symptomatic improvement has been shown in the short term, concerns about the durability and longevity of the fibrocartilaginous repair have been raised. In response, a number of strategies and techniques for augmentation of the first-generation microfracture procedure have been introduced in an effort to improve repair tissue characteristics and reduce long-term deterioration. Recent experimental approaches utilize modern tissue-engineering technologies including local supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors, hyaluronic acid, or cytokine modulation.

These defects have a low probability of healing spontaneously and therefore often require surgical intervention. Originally adapted from the knee, microfracture is part of a spectrum of cartilage repair options that include palliative procedures such as debridement and lavage, reparative procedures such as marrow-stimulating techniques (abrasion arthroplasty and microfracture), and restorative procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral allograft/autografts. The basic indications for microfracture of the hip include focal and contained lesions typically less than 4 cm in diameter, full-thickness (Outerbridge grade IV) defects in weightbearing areas, unstable lesions with intact subchondral bone, and focal lesions without evidence of surrounding chondromalacia. Although not extensively studied in the hip, there are some small clinical series with promising early outcomes.

In the knee joint of miniature pigs, cartilage lesions were treated by microfracturing and were then either left empty, covered with a collagen membrane, or treated by matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation. In control lesions, the subchondral bone plate was left intact (partial-thickness lesion). The repair tissues were analyzed after 12 weeks by histological methods focusing on bone formation and vascularization. The effect of chondrocytes on angiogenesis was assessed by in vitro assays. The presence of antiangiogenic proteins in cartilage repair tissue, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and chondromodulin-I (ChM-I), was detected immunohistochemically and their expression in chondrocytes and bone marrow stromal cells was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Significant outgrowths of subchondral bone and excessive endochondral ossification within the repair tissue were regularly observed in lesions with an exposed or microfractured subchondral bone plate. In contrast, such excessive bone formation was significantly inhibited by the additional transplantation of chondrocytes. Cartilaginous repair tissue that resisted ossification was strongly positive for the antiangiogenic proteins, TSP-1 and ChM-I, which were, however, not detectable in vascularized osseous outgrowths. Chondrocytes were identified to be the major source of TSP-1- and ChM-I expression and were shown to counteract the angiogenic activity of endothelial cells. These data suggest that the resistance of cartilaginous repair tissue against endochondral ossification following the transplantation of chondrocytes is associated with the presence of antiangiogenic proteins whose individual relevance has yet to be further explored.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

19171282,New technique for cell-seeded collagen-matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation.,Matthias Steinwachs,"Autologous chondrocyte transplantation/implantation (ACT/ACI) is becoming increasingly common for the treatment of large cartilage defects in the knee joint. The traditional ACT technique involves injection of a suspension of cells into the cartilage defect, which is covered with a periosteal flap or collagen membrane. The technique requires extensive suturing to create an effective seal; however, cell leakage remains a potential problem. Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI/MACT) avoids this potential problem by using a membrane on which chondrocytes are seeded and cultured for several days, before the membrane is cut to the correct size and shape of the defect. Time-consuming extensive suturing is unnecessary. However, cutting and repeated manipulation of the seeded membrane may result in the loss of critical chondrocytes. A modified technique termed ACT-collagen membrane seeding (ACT-Cs) has been developed in which expanded chondrocytes are applied to the collagen membrane after it has been cut to size, substantially reducing the risk of viable cell loss while retaining the ease and speed of the MACI/MACT procedure. In addition, the seeding of mitotically active chondrocytes onto the membrane after expansion and immediately before transplantation allows direct application of high cell concentrations.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

As the disease progresses, patients may eventually require surgical intervention to restore the functionality of the affected knees. The current literature review aims to explore two treatment options in regenerative medicine for OA by analyzing the efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) use, as well as determining which population will benefit from these treatments. A total of 1093 patients who were diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral knee osteoarthritis (KOA) were recruited in 23 studies. The experimental groups received either PRP or MSCs injections in comparison to the control groups receiving either hyaluronic acid (HA) or placebo (saline or dextrose) injections. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to evaluate all participants at different time intervals of the studies. Medical imaging evaluations (X-ray or MRI) were used to look for structural improvements. In conclusion, both PRP and MSCs treatments were well tolerated, effective and safe to use. Repeated administrations and higher concentrations resulted in superior clinical improvements. A decrease in cartilage loss was observed in some MSCs trials. No severe adverse effects were documented. PRP treatment proved to be more efficacious among patients with KOA Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade I-II, while MSCs treatment proved to be more beneficial among the KOA KL grade II-III group.",2020,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular pathologies, such as femoroacetabular impingement syndrome and labral tears, when associated with those alterations, has been suggested to provide inferior outcomes to those in patients without subchondral changes. Yet, the direct treatment of subchondral pathology has been limited. Recently, a technique for insufflating bone substitute into the bone marrow lesions of the knee, Subchondroplasty (Zimmer Knee Creations, Exton, PA), has led to promising results. Subchondroplasty has raised attention as a possible minimally invasive procedure to treat cystic changes in the acetabulum in patients who are not yet candidates for hip replacement. We present the technique of acetabular Subchondroplasty, in which a bone substitute material is injected into subchondral acetabular cysts under fluoroscopic guidance.

If nonsurgical management fails, surgical treatment is largely based on the size and location of the cartilage defect. Preservation of the patient's native cartilage is preferred if an osteochondral fragment can be salvaged. Chondroplasty and osteochondral autograft transfer are typically used to treat small (<2 cm) cartilage defects. Microfracture has not been shown to be superior to chondroplasty alone and has potential adverse effects, including cyst and intralesional osteophyte formation.

Bone marrow stimulation with MFx often is considered a first-line treatment option, given the ease and low cost of the procedure, as well as the good short-term outcomes. However, multiple studies have recently shown the outcomes of knee MFx to worsen after 5 years postoperatively, particularly for larger lesions. Because of this, ACI has been proposed as a first-line rather than salvage procedure for focal chondral defects in the knee. Although it is important to understand the differences in clinical outcomes between ACI and MFx at mid-term follow-up, longer-term outcomes need to be further investigated. In addition, it may be more appropriate to focus on the comparison of MFx with newer-generation techniques of chondrocyte implantation matrix-associated ACI rather than a collation of historical 2-step ACI using periosteum and newer techniques.",2020,Jeyaraman_2020,0

With IACUC approval, purpose-bred research hounds (n = 24) underwent arthroscopic impact injury (40 N) to both medial femoral condyles. At 3 months, functional assessments, arthroscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. One knee in each dog (n = 24; n = 12 per endpoint) was randomly assigned to SCP with the other knee randomly assigned to SCP + PRP, SCP + BMC or sham injection (control) (n = 8 per group; n = 4 per endpoint). Dogs were evaluated at 6 and 12 months after treatment using functional assessments, radiography, arthroscopy, and MRI and humanely euthanatized at 6 or 12 months after treatment for histologic assessments. At 6 months post-treatment, comfortable range-of-motion (CROM) was higher (p < 0.04) in SCP + PRP and SCP + BMC knees compared with controls. At 1 year post-treatment, %Total Pressure Index was higher (p = 0.036) in SCP + BMC compared with controls, pain was lower (p < 0.05) in SCP + BMC and SCP + PRP compared with SCP and controls, and CROM was higher (p < 0.05) in SCP + BMC and SCP + PRP compared with SCP and controls. Knees treated with SCP + PRP and SCP + BMC had better (p < 0.05) MRI grades than SCP and controls. No statistically significant differences in arthroscopic or histologic pathology were noted.

Many processes can result in cartilage injury, ranging from acute trauma to degenerative processes. Articular cartilage lacks vascularity, and therefore most chondral defects do not heal spontaneously and may require surgical repair.

The most important feature of such implants is their appropriate rate of biodegradation, without the production of toxic metabolites. This study presents work on two different membranes made of polyester (L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone-PLCA) named ""PVP and ""Z"". The difference between them was the use of different pore precursors-polyvinylpyrrolidone in the ""PVP"" scaffold and gelatin in the ""Z"" scaffold. These were implemented in the articular cartilage defects of rabbit knee joints (defects were created for the purpose of the study). After 8, 16, and 24 weeks of observation, and the subsequent termination of the animals, histopathology and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) examinations were performed. Statistical analysis proved that the membranes support the regeneration process. GPC testing proved that the biodegradation process is progressing exponentially, causing the membranes to degrade at the appropriate time. The surgical technique we used meets all the requirements without causing the membrane to migrate after implantation. The ""PVP"" membrane is better due to the fact that after 24 weeks of observation there was a statistical trend for higher histological ratings. It is also better because it is easier to implant due to its lower fragility then membrane ""Z"".

It commonly occurs in the knee joint, elbow, wrist, and ankle. Although several surgical concepts have been described to treat OCD (fragment fixation, microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and mosaicplasty), no gold standard treatment has been accepted for managing OCD. Multiple factors like age, stability of defect, and defect size should be considered while selecting a specific treatment for OCD. Here, we discuss the case of an 18-year-old patient with horizontal and noncontained OCD.

We aimed to systematically organize stem cell treatment methods by reviewing the literature. The treatment methods used in 27 clinical trials were examined and reviewed. The clinical processes were separated into seven categories: cell donor, cell source, cell preparation, delivery methods, lesion preparation, concomitant procedures, and evaluation. Stem cell donors were sub-classified as autologous and allogeneic, and stem cell sources included bone marrow, adipose tissue, peripheral blood, synovium, placenta, and umbilical cord. Mesenchymal stem cells can be prepared by the expansion or isolation process and attached directly to cartilage defects using matrices or injected into joints under arthroscopic observation. The lesion preparation category can be divided into three subcategories: chondroplasty, microfracture, and subchondral drilling. The concomitant procedure category describes adjuvant surgery, such as high tibial osteotomy. Classification codes were assigned for each subcategory to provide a useful and convenient method for organizing documents associated with stem cell treatment. This classification system will help researchers choose more unified treatment methods, which will facilitate the efficient comparison and verification of future clinical outcomes of stem cell therapy for osteoarthritis.",2021,Jeyaraman_2020,0
34863377,Surgical Treatment for Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus.,"Robert T Powers, Thomas C Dowd, Eric Giza","Osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT) are often associated with ankle pain and dysfunction. They can occur after ankle trauma, such as sprains or fractures, but they usually present as a continued ankle pain after the initial injury has resolved. Chronic ankle ligament instability and subsequent microtrauma may lead to insidious development of an OLT. Medial-sided lesions are more common (67%) than lateral-sided lesions. For acute lesions that are nondisplaced, nonoperative management is initially performed, with a 4-6 week period of immobilization and protected weight bearing. Symptomatic improvement results in more than 50% of patients by 3 months. Acute osteochondral talus fractures, which have a bone fragment thickness greater than 3 mm with displacement will benefit from early surgical intervention. These injuries should undergo primary repair via internal fixation with bioabsorbable compression screws 3.0 mm or smaller using at least 2 points of fixation. Acute lesions that are too small for fixation can be treated with morselization and reimplantation of the cartilage fragments. If OLTs are persistently symptomatic following an appropriate course of nonoperative treatment, various reparative and restorative surgical options may be considered on the basis of diameter, surface area, depth, and location of the lesion. A small subset of symptomatic osteochondral lesions of the talus involve subchondral pathology with intact overlying articular cartilage; in these cases, retrograde drilling into the cystic lesion can be employed to induce underlying bony healing. Cancellous bone graft augmentation may be used for subchondral cysts with volume greater than 100 mm",2021,Jeyaraman_2020,0

This fact is also apparent in the wide variety of available surgical approaches to FCDs. Although simple arthroscopic debridement or microfracture are usually the first line of treatment for smaller lesions, chondral lesions that involve a larger area or depth require restorative procedures such as osteochondral allograft transplantation or other cell-based techniques.

An indirect co-culture model was developed, representing a chondrocyte/scaffold-construct repair of a cartilage defect adjoining bone, where the bone could have varying degrees of degeneration. Human BM-MSCs were isolated from two areas of subchondral bone in each of five osteochondral tissue specimens from five patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. These two areas underlaid the macroscopically and histologically best and worst cartilage, representing early and late-stage OA, respectively.

Despite the complex pathomorphological changes that occur in OA, the approach to different forms of OA is standardized. The global results from pharmacological treatment are not satisfactory. Hence, this study aimed to explore the effects of metformin, alendronate, and their combination on OA development and progression in mice with collagenase-induced osteoarthritis (CIOA). Female ICR (CD-2) mice were randomized to five groups: control group, CIOA untreated, CIOA + metformin, CIOA + alendronate, and CIOA + metformin + alendronate. OA was induced by the intra-articular (i.a.) injection of collagenase. OA phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry (bone marrow cell differentiation), ELISA (serum levels of the adipokines leptin and resistin), and histology (pathological changes of the knee joint). Treatment with metformin, alendronate, or their combination inhibited the expression of RANK and RANKL on osteoblasts and osteoclasts obtained by ex vivo cultivation of bone marrow cells in mineralization or osteoclastogenic media. In addition, metformin treatment was effective for the attenuation of fibroblast differentiation, but not of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), while alendronate had an opposite effect. The combination of metformin and alendronate had a suppressive effect on both MSCs and fibroblasts differentiation. Treatment with metformin, alendronate, and their combination decreased serum concentrations of leptin and resistin in the chronic phase of arthritis. The histopathological examination showed that compared with the untreated CIOA group (OA score 9), the groups treated with metformin (OA score 4) or alendronate (OA score 6) had lower scores for cartilage changes. Metformin combined with alendronate significantly decreased the degree of cartilage degeneration (OA score 2), suggesting that this combination might be a useful approach for the treatment of OA patients.",2021,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Most of the studies were performed with intra-articular injections. However, subchondral bone plays an important role in the progression of osteoarthritis. We investigated by a literature review whether joint, subchondral bone, or/and scaffolds implantation of fresh autologous bone marrow aspirate concentrated (BMAC) containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) would improve osteoarthritis (OA). There is in vivo evidence that suggests that all these different approaches (intra-articular injections, subchondral implantation, scaffolds loaded with BMAC) can improve the patient. This review analyzes the evidence for each different approach to treat OA. We found that the use of intra-articular injections resulted in a significant relief of pain symptoms in the short term and was maintained in 12 months. However, the clinical trials indicate that the application of autologous bone marrow concentrates in combination with scaffolds or in injection in the subchondral bone was superior to intra-articular injection for long-term results. The tendency of MSCs to differentiate into fibrocartilage affecting the outcome was a common issue faced by all the studies when biopsies were performed, except for scaffolds implantation in which some hyaline cartilage was found.

33833044,Surgical treatment of complex meniscus tear and disease: state of the art.,"Nobutake Ozeki, Romain Seil, Aaron J Krych, Hideyuki Koga","The meniscus is important for load distribution, shock absorption and stability of the knee joint. Meniscus injury or meniscectomy results in decreased function of the meniscus and increased risk of knee osteoarthritis. To preserve the meniscal functions, meniscal repair should be considered as the first option for meniscus injury. Although reoperation rates are higher after meniscal repair compared with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, long-term follow-up of meniscal repair demonstrated better clinical outcomes and less severe degenerative changes of osteoarthritis compared with partial meniscectomy. In the past, the indication of a meniscal repair was limited both because of technical reasons and due to the localised vascularity of the meniscus. Meanwhile, it spreads today as the development of the concept to preserve the meniscus and the improvement of meniscal repair techniques. Longitudinal vertical tears in the peripheral third are considered the 'gold standard' indication in terms of meniscus healing. Techniques for meniscal repair include 'inside-out', 'outside-in' and 'all-inside' strategies. Surgical decision-making depends on the type, size and location of the meniscus injury. Meniscal root tears substantially affect meniscal hoop function and accelerate cartilage degeneration; therefore, meniscus root repair is necessary to prevent the progression of osteoarthritis change. For symptomatic meniscus defects after meniscectomy, transplantation of allograft or collagen meniscus implant may be indicated, and acceptable clinical results have been obtained. Recently, meniscus extrusion has attracted attention due to increased interest in early osteoarthritis. The centralisation techniques have been proposed to reduce the meniscus extrusion by suturing the meniscus-capsule complex to the edge of the tibial plateau. Long-term clinical outcomes of this procedure may change the strategy of treating meniscus extrusion. When malalignment of the lower leg is accompanied with meniscus pathologies, knee osteotomies are a reasonable option to protect the repaired meniscus by unloading the pathological compartment. Advancements in biological augmentation such as bone marrow stimulation, fibrin clot, platelet-rich plasma, stem cell therapy and scaffolds have also expanded the indications for meniscus surgery. In summary, improved repair techniques and biological augmentation have made meniscus repair more appealing to treat that had previously been considered irreparable. However, further research would be necessary to validate the efficacy of these specialised technique.",2021,Jeyaraman_2020,0
33800401,Potential Mechanism of Action of Current Point-of-Care Autologous Therapy Treatments for Osteoarthritis of the Knee-A Narrative Review.,"Jennifer Woodell-May, Kathleen Steckbeck, William King","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degenerative disease that manifests as pain and inflammation and often results in total joint replacement. There is significant interest in understanding how intra-articular injections made from autologous blood or bone marrow could alleviate symptoms and potentially intervene in the progression of the disease. There is in vitro an in vivo evidence that suggests that these therapies, including platelet-rich plasma (PRP), autologous anti-inflammatories (AAIs), and concentrated bone marrow aspirate (cBMA), can interrupt cartilage matrix degradation driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines. This review analyzes the evidence for and against inclusion of white blood cells, the potential role of platelets, and the less studied potential role of blood plasma when combining these components to create an autologous point-of-care therapy to treat OA. There has been significant focus on the differences between the various autologous therapies. However, evidence suggests that there may be more in common between groups and perhaps we should be thinking of these therapies on a spectrum of the same technology, each providing significant levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines that can be antagonists against the inflammatory cytokines driving OA symptoms and progression.

Therefore, strategies to promote meniscus repair and improve meniscus function are needed. The objective of this study was to generate porcine meniscus-derived matrix (MDM) scaffolds and test their effectiveness in promoting meniscus repair via migration of endogenous meniscus cells from the surrounding meniscus or exogenously seeded human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Both endogenous meniscal cells and MSCs infiltrated the MDM scaffolds. In the absence of exogenous cells, the 8% MDM scaffolds promoted the integrative repair of an in vitro meniscal defect. Dehydrothermal crosslinking and concentration of the MDM influenced the biochemical content and shear strength of repair, demonstrating that the MDM can be tailored to promote tissue repair. These findings indicate that native meniscus cells can enhance meniscus healing if a scaffold is provided that promotes cellular infiltration and tissue growth.

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) may be performed after failed microfracture surgery. Alterations to subchondral bone as intralesional osteophytes are commonly seen after previous microfracture and removed during ACI. There have been no reports on potential recurrence. Our purpose was to evaluate the incidence of intralesional osteophyte development in 2 cohorts: existing intralesional osteophytes and without intralesional osteophytes at the time of ACI. Study Design We identified 87 patients (157 lesions) with intralesional osteophytes among a cohort of 497 ACI patients. Osteophyte regrowth was analyzed on magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as small or large (less or more than 50% of the cartilage thickness). Twenty patients (24 defects) without intralesional osteophytes at the time of ACI acted as control. Results Osteophyte regrowth was observed in 39.5% of lesions (34.4% of small osteophytes and 5.1% of large osteophytes). In subgroup analyses, regrowth was observed in 45.8% of periosteal-covered defects and in 18.9% of collagen membrane-covered defects. Large osteophyte regrowth occurred in less than 5% in either group. Periosteal defects showed a significantly higher incidence for regrowth of small osteophytes. In the control group, intralesional osteophytes developed in 16.7% of the lesions. Conclusions Even though intralesional osteophytes may regrow after removal during ACI, most of them are small. Small osteophyte regrowth occurs almost twice in periosteum-covered ACI. Large osteophytes occur only in 5% of patients.

The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence-based overview of clinical outcomes following biologic augmentation to surgical treatments for OLT.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0
27882808,No degeneration found in focal cartilage defects evaluated with dGEMRIC at 12-year follow-up.,"Cathrine Nørstad Engen, Sverre Løken, Asbjørn Årøen, Charles Ho, Lars Engebretsen","Background and purpose - The natural history of focal cartilage defects (FCDs) is still unresolved, as is the long-term cartilage quality after cartilage surgery. It has been suggested that delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) is a biomarker of early OA. We aimed to quantitatively evaluate the articular cartilage in knees with FCDs, 12 years after arthroscopic diagnosis. Patients and methods - We included 21 patients from a cohort of patients with knee pain who underwent arthroscopy in 1999. Patients with a full-thickness cartilage defect, stable knees, and at least 50% of both their menisci intact at baseline were eligible. 10 patients had cartilage repair performed at baseline (microfracture or autologous chondrocyte implantation), whereas 11 patients had either no additional surgery or simple debridement performed. Mean follow-up time was 12 (10-13) years. The morphology and biochemical features were evaluated with dGEMRIC and T2 mapping. Standing radiographs for Kellgren and Lawrence (K&L) classification of osteoarthritis (OA) were obtained. Knee function was assessed with VAS, Tegner, Lysholm, and KOOS. Results - The dGEMRIC showed varying results but, overall, no increased degeneration of the injured knees. Degenerative changes (K&L above 0) were, however, evident in 13 of the 21 knees. Interpretation - The natural history of untreated FCDs shows large dGEMRIC variations, as does the knee articular cartilage of surgically treated patients. In this study, radiographic OA changes did not correlate with cartilage quality, as assessed with dGEMRIC.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

It is a 2-stage operation, with the second stage most commonly performed via mini-arthrotomy. Arthroscopic ACI is gaining popularity, as it is less invasive and may accelerate early rehabilitation. However, handling and manipulation of the implant have been shown to cause chondrocyte cell death.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Autologous chondrocyte implantation is the current gold standard but the technique is expensive, time-consuming and most versions require two stage procedures and an arthrotomy. Autologous collagen induced chondrogenesis (ACIC) is a single-stage arthroscopic procedure and we developed. This method uses microfracture technique with atelocollagen mixed with fibrin gel to treat articular cartilage defects.

There have been multiple approaches to treat such lesions, including arthroscopic debridement, microfracture, multiple drilling, osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) that are currently being used in clinical practice. Autologous bone-marrow mesenchymal cell induced chondrogenesis (MCIC) is a single-staged arthroscopic procedure. This method combines a modified microfracture technique with the application of a bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC), hyaluronic acid and fibrin gel to treat articular cartilage defects.

27135292,"Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation: Past, Present, and Future.","Tyler Welch, Bert Mandelbaum, Minas Tom","Focal cartilage defects of the knee are relatively common and may increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) aims to restore the integrity of isolated cartilage lesions through the induction of hyaline-like cartilage formation. Although ACI has traditionally been used as a second-line treatment, recent evidence suggests that ACI should be considered as a first-line treatment option in certain patients. Recent controlled trials also suggest that there are improved clinical outcomes among those patients who undergo ACI over the mid-term and long-term compared with those treated with microfracture or osteochondral autograft/mosaicplasty, regardless of lesion size. Recent literature also indicates that arthroscopic, second-generation and third-generation techniques are associated with better outcomes and fewer complications than first-generation ACI. In summary, ACI is an effective tool for cartilage restoration that may be more efficacious and durable than other cartilage restoration techniques for appropriate candidates.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Injury of cartilage often progresses from the articular surface to the subchondral bone, leading to pathogenesis of tissue degenerative diseases, such as osteoarthritis. Therapies to treat cartilage defects using autologous chondrocyte-based tissue engineering have been developed and used for more than 20 years; however, the challenge of chondrocyte expansion in vitro remains. A promising cell source, cartilage stem/progenitor cells (CSPCs), has attracted recent attention. Because their origin and identity are still unclear, the application potential of CSPCs is under active investigation. Here we have captured the emergence of a group of stem/progenitor cells derived from adult human chondrocytes, highlighted by dynamic changes in expression of the mature chondrocyte marker, COL2, and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) marker, CD146. These cells are termed chondrocyte-derived progenitor cells (CDPCs). The stem cell-like potency and differentiation status of CDPCs were determined by physical and biochemical cues during culture. A low-density, low-glucose 2-dimensional culture condition (2DLL) was critical for the emergence and proliferation enhancement of CDPCs. CDPCs showed similar phenotype as bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells but exhibited greater chondrogenic potential. Moreover, the 2DLL-cultured CDPCs proved efficient in cartilage formation both in vitro and in vivo and in repairing large knee cartilage defects (6-13 cm(2)) in 15 patients. These findings suggest a phenotype conversion between chondrocytes and CDPCs and provide conditions that promote the conversion. These insights expand our understanding of cartilage biology and may enhance the success of chondrocyte-based therapies.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Healthy and diseased engineered cartilage from human chondrocytes (cultured in agar gels) were integrated with human bone marrow stem cell (HBMSC)-derived cartilaginous engineered matrix with and without HA, and evaluated after 28 days of growth. HBMSCs were seeded within photopolymerizable poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogels. In addition, we also conducted a preliminary in vivo evaluation of cartilage repair in rabbit knee chondral defects treated with subchondral bone microfracture and cell-free PEGDA with and without HA. Under in vitro conditions, the interfacial shear strength between tissue engineered cartilage derived from HBMSCs and osteoarthritic chondrocytes was significantly higher (p < 0.05) when HA nanoparticles were incorporated within the HBMSC culture system. Histological evidence confirmed a distinct spatial transition zone, rich in calcium phosphate deposits. Assessment of explanted rabbit knees by histology demonstrated that cellularity within the repair tissues that had filled the defects were of significantly higher number (p < 0.05) when HA was used. HA nanoparticles play an important role in treating chondral defects when osteoarthritis is a co-morbidity. We speculate that the calcified layer formation at the interface in the osteoarthritic environment in the presence of HA is likely to have attributed to higher interfacial strength found in vitro. From an in vivo standpoint, the presence of HA promoted cellularity in the tissues that subsequently filled the chondral defects. This higher presence of cells can be considered important in the context of accelerating long-term cartilage remodeling. We conclude that HA nanoparticles play an important role in engineered to native cartilage integration and cellular processes.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

OCD is seen in children and adolescents with open growth plates (juvenile OCD) and adults with closed growth plates (adult OCD). The etiology of OCD lesions remains unclear and is characterized by an aseptic necrosis in the subchondral bone area. Mechanical factors seem to play an important role. Clinical symptoms are unspecific. Thus, imaging techniques are most important. Regarding treatment, a tremendous number of publications exist. Spontaneous healing is expected unless there is an unstable fragment, and treatment involves rest and different degrees of immobilization until healing. Patients with open physes and low-grade lesions have good results with conservative therapy. When surgery is necessary, the procedure depends on the stage and on the state of the cartilage. With intact cartilage, retrograde procedures are favorable. When the cartilage is damaged, several techniques can be used. While techniques such as drilling and microfracturing produce reparative cartilage, other techniques reconstruct the defect with additional osteochondral grafts or cell-based procedures such as chondrocyte transplantation. There is a tendency toward better results when using procedures that reconstruct the bone and the cartilage and there is also a trend toward better long-term results when comorbidities are treated.

Adipose-derived stem cells and possibly other adipose-based therapies have a greater chondrogenic potential than stem cells derived from bone marrow, and thus a lot of attention is being placed on them as potential regenerative agents in the treatment of knee OA. Several types of adipose-based therapies have good basic science and preclinical data supporting their translation to human therapeutic intervention. Cultured, adipose-derived stem cells appear to be good source of bioactive cells with convenient accessibility, relative abundance, and well-documented regenerative capacity. Non-culture expanded adipose-based therapy, in the forms of stromal vascular fraction and most recently micronized adipose tissue (MAT), have been utilized in patients to treat OA and other cartilage abnormalities with encouraging preliminary data. These adipose-based therapies have shown a lot of therapeutic potential; however, because of the regulatory restrictions on enzymatic isolation and cell expansion, only MAT is currently available in clinical practice in the United States.

With increasing basic science and clinical evidence showing efficacy, cell-based therapies such as bone marrow concentrate (BMC) hold promise as a nonsurgical joint preserving treatment approach. BMC has inherent advantages over other treatments commonly used for various knee pathologies because it is a point-of-care orthobiologic product that uniquely and simultaneously delivers growth factors, anti-inflammatory proteins, and mesenchymal stem cells. There is increasing evidence for the use of BMC for repair of focal cartilage defects and for the treatment of generalized knee pain.

Autologous cell-based cartilage repair, for example, autologous chondrocyte implantation, is limited by the need for ex vivo chondrocyte expansion and donor site morbidity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), owing to their relative ease of isolation, higher replication activity, and chondrogenic potential, represent an alternative reparative cell type. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous, growth factor-rich biologic preparation that has recently received increasing attention and use as a therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases, and there is evidence suggesting that PRP acts by promoting stem cell proliferation and tissue healing. In this study, we have examined the effect of PRP treatment on chondrogenic differentiation of adult human MSCs derived from infrapatellar fat pad-adipose stem cells (IFP-ASCs) and bone marrow (BM-MSCs). Both cell types were placed in high-density pellet culture and hydrogel-encapsulated culture under chondrogenic conditions. Our results showed that PRP did not improve IFP-ASC or BM-MSC chondrogenesis. In general, chondrogenesis was inhibited with increasing PRP concentrations and duration of exposure, on the basis of histological, biochemical, and gene expression analyses. Taken together, these findings suggest that although PRP is reported to be beneficial in terms of pain relief and joint function improvement, its mechanism of action is unlikely to directly involve enhancement of MSC-mediated hyaline cartilage formation.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Current Procedural Terminology codes for all patients undergoing MFX, ACI, OATS, and OCA were used to search a prospectively collected, commercially available private payer insurance company database from 2007 to 2011. Within 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery, the database was searched for the occurrence of these same patients undergoing knee diagnostic arthroscopy with biopsy, lysis of adhesions, synovectomy, arthroscopy for infection or lavage, arthroscopy for removal of loose bodies, chondroplasty, MFX, ACI, OATS, OCA, and/or knee arthroplasty. Descriptive statistical analysis and contingency table analysis were performed. A total of 47,207 cartilage procedures were performed from 2007 to 2011, including 43,576 MFX, 640 ACI, 386 open OATS, 997 arthroscopic OATS, 714 open OCA, and 894 arthroscopic OCA procedures.

The challenge has been to develop techniques that are cost effective single-stage procedures with minimal surgical trauma that have undergone rigorous preclinical scrutiny and robust reproducible assessment of effectiveness. A biological repair requires the generation of a cellular and matrix composite with appropriate signalling for chondrogenic differentiation. Methods and results A technique was developed that allowed chondrogenic primary (uncultured) cells from bone marrow aspirate concentrate, combined with a composite hydrophilic and fibrillar matrix to be applied arthroscopically to a site of a chondral lesion. The construct was tested in vitro and in animal experiments before clinical trials. Clinical trials involved 60 patients in a prospective study. Symptomatic International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3 and 4a lesions were mapped and treated.

29396963,Cartilage Restoration: Microfracture and Osteochondral Autograft Transplantation.,"Michael L Redondo, Adam J Beer, Adam B Yanke","The treatment of patellofemoral cartilage defects presents several distinct challenges when compared with cartilage restoration techniques used for other compartments of the knee due to the unique anatomy and distribution of forces. The etiologies of patellofemoral articular cartilage lesions include acute traumatic instability injuries, such as dislocation and subluxation, osteochondritis dissecans, and chronic degenerative changes. Regardless of the etiology, untreated patellofemoral cartilage lesions can contribute to activity-limiting anterior knee pain. The goal of patellofemoral cartilage restoration procedures is to impart symptomatic relief and improve quality of life by repairing the articular cartilage surface and any comorbid malalignment or maltracking.Microfracture and osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) are two cartilage restoration procedures to consider when treating full-thickness patellofemoral chondral defects. Considered by some experts to be the gold standard therapy, microfracture is one of the most common procedures used for cartilage restoration. The technique involves the perforation of the subchondral bone plate for the release of marrow elements, filling the defect with a fibrocartilage clot repair. Though less commonly used, OAT allows defect replacement with native hyaline cartilage via autologous transplantation from a non-weight bearing area. The purpose of this article is to discuss the indication, technical considerations, and outcomes of microfracture and OAT when used for treating chondral lesions of the patellofemoral joint.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

A Systematic Review.,"Armin Arshi, Peter D Fabricant, Derek E Go, Riley J Williams, David R McAllister, Kristofer J Jones","Objective To perform a systematic review of clinical outcomes following microfracture augmented with biological adjuvants (MFX+) compared with microfracture (MFX) alone. Design The MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched for clinical studies on MFX+ for chondral defects of the knee. Study characteristics and clinical outcome score data were collected. Subjective synthesis was performed using data from randomized controlled studies to determine effect size of MFX+ procedures performed with either injectable or scaffold-based augmentation compared with MFX alone. Results A total of 18 articles reporting on 625 patients (491 MFX+, 134 MFX) were identified. Six studies were level II evidence and 1 study was level I evidence. Mean patient age range was 26 to 51 years, and mean follow-up ranged from 2 to 5 years. All studies demonstrated significant improvement in reported clinical outcome scores at follow-up after MFX+ therapy, and 87% of patients reported satisfaction with treatment. The most commonly reported treatment complication was postoperative stiffness (3.9% of patients). Subjective synthesis on randomized controlled trials demonstrated that 2/2 injectable MFX+ interventions had significantly greater improvements in International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC; P = 0.004) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS; P = 0.012) scores compared with MFX alone, while 2/2 trials on scaffolding MFX+ adjuvants showed comparable postoperative improvements. Conclusions MFX+ biological adjuvants are safe supplements to marrow stimulation for treating cartilage defects in the adult knee. Early literature is heterogenous and extremely limited in quality. Individual trials report both equivalent and superior clinical outcomes compared with MFX alone, making definitive conclusions on the efficacy of MFX+ difficult without higher quality evidence.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0
29219025,The Effect of Growth Hormone on Chondral Defect Repair.,"Natalie R Danna, Bryan G Beutel, Austin J Ramme, Thorsten Kirsch, Oran D Kennedy, Eric Strauss","Objective Focal chondral defects alter joint mechanics and cause pain and debilitation. Microfracture is a surgical technique used to treat such defects. This technique involves penetration of subchondral bone to release progenitor cells and growth factors from the marrow to promote cartilage regeneration. Often this results in fibrocartilage formation rather than structured hyaline cartilage. Some reports have suggested use of growth hormone (GH) with microfracture to augment cartilage regeneration. Our objective was to test whether intra-articular (IA) GH in conjunction with microfracture, improves cartilage repair in a rabbit chondral defect model. We hypothesized that GH would exhibit a dose-dependent improvement in regeneration. Design Sixteen New Zealand white rabbits received bilateral femoral chondral defects and standardized microfracture repair. One group of animals ( n = 8) received low-dose GH by IA injection in the left knee, and the other group ( n = 8) received high-dose GH in the same manner. All animals received IA injection of saline in the contralateral knee as control. Serum assays, macroscopic grading, and histological analyses were used to assess any improvements in cartilage repair. Results Peripheral serum GH was not elevated postoperatively ( P = 0.21). There was no improvement in macroscopic grading scores among either of the GH dosages ( P = 0.83). Scoring of safranin-O-stained sections showed no improvement in cartilage regeneration and some evidence of increased bone formation in the GH-treated knees. Conclusions Treatment with either low- or high-dose IA GH does not appear to enhance short-term repair in a rabbit chondral defect model.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Design A literature search was performed using the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases for studies in English (1980-2017) using keywords, including [""bone marrow aspirate"" and ""cartilage""], [""mesenchymal stem cells"" and ""cartilage""], and [""bone marrow aspirate"" and ""mesenchymal stem cells"" and ""orthopedics""]. A total of 1832 articles were reviewed by 2 independent authors and additional literature found through scanning references of cited articles. Results BMAC has demonstrated promising results in the clinical application for repair of chondral defects as an adjuvant procedure or as an independent management technique. A subcomponent of BMAC, bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess the ability to differentiate into cells important for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Modulation of paracrine signaling is perhaps the most important function of BM-MSCs in this setting. In an effort to increase the cellular yield, authors have shown the ability to expand BM-MSCs in culture while maintaining phenotype. Conclusions Translational studies have demonstrated good clinical efficacy of BMAC both concomitant with cartilage restoration procedures, at defined time points after surgery, and as isolated injections. Early clinical data suggests BMAC may help stimulate a more robust hyaline cartilage repair tissue response. Numerous questions remain regarding BMAC usage, including cell source, cell expansion, optimal pathology, and injection timing and quantity.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS Using genetic recombination technique, the genes of cyclooxygenase-2, aggrecanase-1, and insulin-like growth factor-1 were recombined into the lentiviral vectors, and we transfected the human bone marrow stem cells in vitro. The BMSC transfected with lentivirus without genes served as a blank-virus group, and saline was used for another control group. One week later, the cytokines PGE2, aggrecanase-1, hIGF-1, and IL-1 were detected and compared between groups. RESULTS Compared with blank-virus group, the expression of COX-2 (85.81±5.12 ng/L) and aggrecanase1 (6.256±1.66) were decreased in the virus group (p<0.05), while the expression of hIGF-1 (17.46±1.86) was increased (p<0.05). The concentrations of PGE2 (85.81±5.12 ng/L), aggrecanase1 (51.34±5.463 ng/L), and IL-1 (82.31±4.321 ng/L) decreased (p<0.05) within the knee, but the concentration of hIGF-1 (44.33±0.7194 ng/L) increased (p<0.05). Compared with the other groups, the results of histological and immunohistochemical examinations demonstrated that the abrasion of articular cartilage was significantly improved and repaired. CONCLUSIONS Lentivirus-mediated RNAi can inhibit the expression of COX-2 mRNA and aggrecanase-1mRNA, and enhance the hIGF-1 mRNA expression, thereby influencing the concentration of cytokines in the early osteoarthritic model knee joints.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The autologous chondrocytes implantation (ACI) technique has evolved over the past 20 years: the first-generation technique involves the use of a periosteal patch, the second-generation technique (collagen-cover) uses a type I/III collagen membrane, and the newest third-generation technique seeds and cultivates the collagen membrane with chondrocytes prior to implantation and is referred to as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. Particulated juvenile allograft cartilage (PJAC) (DeNovo NT) is minced cartilage allograft from juvenile donors. A thorough physical exam is important, especially for issues affecting the PF joint, to isolate the location and source of pain, and to identify associated pathologies. Imaging studies allow further characterization of the lesions and identification of associated pathologies and alignment. Conservative management should be exhausted before proceeding with surgical treatment. Steps of surgical treatment are diagnostic arthroscopy and biopsy, chondrocytes culture and chondrocyte implantation for the three generations of ACI, and diagnostic arthroscopy and implantation for PJAC.

During the procedure the subchondral bone is penetrated, allowing bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to migrate towards the defect site and form new cartilage tissue. Microfracture surgery generally results in the formation of mechanically inferior fibrocartilage. As a result, this technique offers only temporary clinical improvement. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine may improve the outcome of microfracture surgery. Filling the subchondral defect with a biomaterial may provide a template for the formation of new hyaline cartilage tissue. In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the current evidence for the efficacy of cartilage regeneration in preclinical models using acellular biomaterials implanted after marrow stimulating techniques (microfracturing and subchondral drilling) compared to the natural healing response of defects. The review aims to provide new insights into the most effective biomaterials, to provide an overview of currently existing knowledge, and to identify potential lacunae in current studies to direct future research. A comprehensive search was systematically performed in PubMed and EMBASE (via OvidSP) using search terms related to tissue engineering, cartilage and animals. Primary studies in which acellular biomaterials were implanted in osteochondral defects in the knee or ankle joint in healthy animals were included and study characteristics tabulated (283 studies out of 6,688 studies found). For studies comparing non-treated empty defects to defects containing implanted biomaterials and using semi-quantitative histology as outcome measure, the risk of bias (135 studies) was assessed and outcome data were collected for meta-analysis (151 studies). Random-effects meta-analyses were performed, using cartilage regeneration as outcome measure on an absolute 0-100% scale. Implantation of acellular biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 15.6% compared to non-treated empty defect controls. The addition of biologics to biomaterials significantly improved cartilage regeneration by 7.6% compared to control biomaterials. No significant differences were found between biomaterials from natural or synthetic origin or between scaffolds, hydrogels and blends. No noticeable differences were found in outcome between animal models. The risk of bias assessment indicated poor reporting for the majority of studies, impeding an assessment of the actual risk of bias. In conclusion, implantation of biomaterials in osteochondral defects improves cartilage regeneration compared to natural healing, which is further improved by the incorporation of biologics.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Current methods such as microfracture, osteoarticular autograft transfer system, mosaicplasty, and autologous chondrocyte implantation are somewhat successful in regenerating cartilage; however, they also have significant limitations. The future of fourth generation cartilage repair focuses on gene therapy, the use of stem cells (bone marrow, adipose, or muscle derived), and tissue engineering. Emerging techniques include creating elastin-like polymers derived from native elastin sequences to serve as biocompatible scaffolds; using hydrogels to obtain a homogeneous distribution of cells within a 3-dimensional matrix; and using nonviral gene delivery via nucleofection to allow mesenchymal stem cells the ability to express osteogenic growth factors.

22658361,Mesenchymal stem cell sheet encapsulated cartilage debris provides great potential for cartilage defects repair in osteoarthritis.,"Yiying Qi, Weiqi Yan","The restoration of the degenerated articular cartilage in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) is still a challenge for researchers and clinicians. Drug interventions and surgical treatments have been widely attempted for cartilage regeneration in OA. However, the results were largely unsatisfactory. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) offers potential for the regeneration of cartilage over the long-term. However, due to the limitations and disadvantages of ACI, alternative therapies for cartilage regeneration are in need. The availability of large quantities of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the multilineage differentiation, especially their chondrogenic differentiation property, have made MSCs the most promising cell source for cartilage regeneration. In addition, MSCs have been shown the ability to undergo site-specific differentiation. MSCs can be obtained as MSC sheets using the temperature-responsive culture dish method. The MSC sheet can provide amounts of cells and extracellular matrix, which might provide the continuity between the implant and host cartilage, thus improving integrative cartilage repair. Moreover, OA is associated with progressive and often severe inflammation. MSCs not only have the ability to contribute structurally to tissue repair, but also possess potent immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Taken together, these properties make MSC sheet promising candidate for cartilage repair in OA. We hypothesize that MSC sheet encapsulated cartilage debris can efficiently promote cartilage repair in OA patients. Chondrocytes can be obtained and cultured from small cartilage debris in vitro. Therefore, the chondrocytes may grow from the debris in cartilage defect and improve cartilage regeneration. MSC sheet provide amounts of cells, ECM and protein for cartilage regeneration and integration, and may play some roles of periosteum. The operation of MSC sheet encapsulated cartilage debris for cartilage repair is simple and practical. Moreover, the cell sheet/cartilage debris constructs can be easily shaped based on the size and shape of cartilage defects.

Our study investigates the possibility of direct intra-articular injection of mesenchymal stem cells suspended in hyaluronic acid (HA) as an alternative to the much more invasive methods currently available. A partial-thickness (without penetration of the subchondral bone) cartilage defect was created in the medial femoral condyle of an adult minipig. Mesenchymal stem cells from the iliac crest marrow of the same pig harvested in a separate procedure and suspended in 2 milliliters of hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc) were injected intra-articularly after the creation of the defect. This was followed by two more injections of hylan G-F 20 (HA) at weekly intervals. Either saline or HA was injected into the knees of the controls. The pigs were sacrificed at 6 and 12 weeks for morphological and histological analysis. The cell-treated groups showed improved cartilage healing both histologically and morphologically at 6 and 12 weeks compared with both controls. The use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal stem cells suspended in HA is a viable option for treating large cartilage defects.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed doubled thickness of the regenerated cartilage tissue in the group treated with our aggrecan functionalized scaffold compared to standard microfracture treatment. H&E staining showed 366 ± 95 chondrocytes present in the unit area of cartilage layer with the support of bioactive scaffold, while conventional microfracture group showed only 112 ± 26 chondrocytes. The expression of type II collagen appeared almost 10 times higher with our approach compared to normal microfracture, indicating the potential to overcome the fibro-cartilage formation associated with the current microfracture approach. The therapeutic effect was also evaluated at joint function level. The mobility was evaluated using a modified Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale.

We aimed to explore the feasibility of repair of articular cartilage defects with tissue-engineered cartilage constructed by acellular cartilage matrices (ACMs) seeded with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs). The ADSCs were isolated from 3-month-old New Zealand albino rabbit by using collagenase and cultured and amplified in vitro. Fresh cartilage isolated from adult New Zealand albino rabbit were freeze-dried for 12 h and treated with Triton X-100, DNase, and RNase to obtain ACMs. ADSCs were seeded in the acellular cartilaginous matrix at 2x10(7)/mL, and cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium for 2 weeks to construct tissue-engineered cartilage. Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into A, B, and C groups. Engineered cartilage was transplanted into cartilage defect position of rabbits in group A, group B obtained ACMs, and group C did not receive any transplants. The rabbits were sacrificed in week 12. The restored tissue was evaluated using macroscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In the tissue-engineered cartilage group (group A), articular cartilage defects of the rabbits were filled with chondrocyte-like tissue with smooth surface. Immunohistochemistry showed type II-collagen expression and Alcian blue staining was positive. TEM showed chondrocytes in the recesses, with plenty of secretary matrix particles. In the scaffold group (group B), the defect was filled with fibrous tissue. No repaired tissue was found in the blank group (group C).

19896059,Arthroscopic implantation of a matrix to cover large chondral defect during microfracture.,"Thore Zantop, Wolf Petersen","Microfracturing techniques have been reported to be successful cartilage-restoring treatment options in defects of smaller sizes. The success may be limited by the size of the defect and the shoulder of the intact surrounding cartilage. We report a new technique using a 3-dimensional matrix to cover large cartilage defects during microfracture healing. In contrast to autologous chondrocyte implantation techniques, this technique is a 1-stage procedure. The defect cover consists of a resorbable polymer felt and sodium hyaluronan to induce hemostasis and to protect the underlying tissue. After conventional microfracture, the defect size is determined with an intra-articular measuring device, and the matrix is sized and introduced with an arthroscopic grasp. Depending on the size of the defect, the 3-dimensional matrix is fixed with 1 or 2 biodegradable pins perpendicular to the surface. The combination of the common microfracture technique with the implantation of the matrix leads to complete defect filling with cartilaginous repair tissue and therefore improves cartilage regeneration in the defect. We conclude that the introduced technique may be helpful in large cartilage defects combining the benefit of microfracturing and avoidance of the increased morbidity of matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte implantation.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Ten knees of 10 patients were studied. The signal intensities of reparative and normal cartilage were evaluated by fat-suppressed three-dimensional spoiled-gradient recalled (FS 3D-SPGR) MR imaging. The signal intensity (SI) index (signal intensity of reparative cartilage divided by that of normal cartilage) was defined and the change in SI index was investigated. Histological and biochemical evaluation was done at the second look arthroscopy. The SI index was at its lowest level immediately after ACI and increased with time to 9 months thereafter. After 9-12 months, the SI index settled to almost level and was maintained at that value for at least 2-3 years postoperatively. The average of the SI indexes after 12 months to the last examination was 74.2 +/- 4.6 (range 64.2-82.8), which means signal intensity of reparative cartilage was maintained at a value lower than that of normal cartilage. The total ICRS score was 11.6 +/- 2.3 points (mean +/- SD). The GAG concentration was 107.9 +/- 17.0 microg/mg (mean +/- SD) in normal cartilage and 65.9 +/- 9.4 microg/mg in reparative cartilage. The quality of reparative cartilage as hyaline cartilage was inferior to that of normal cartilage. In the present study, the time course change in the SI index indicates that the major maturation process of implanted chondrocytes neared completion in 9-12 months. Minor changes, such as matrix remodeling with reorganization of the collagen fibers in reparative cartilage, may continue, but an almost identical condition seemed to be maintained during the first 2-3 years of follow-up.

Currently, cartilage lesions are often treated by microfracture or autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). However, these treatments are frequently reported to result in a mixture of the desired hyaline cartilage and mechanically inferior fibrocartilage. In this study, by combining the advantages of cartilage tissue engineering and decellularization technology, we developed a decellularized allogeneic hyaline cartilage graft, named dLhCG, which achieved superior efficacy in articular cartilage repair and surpassed living autologous chondrocyte-based cartilaginous engraftment and ACI. By the 6-month time point after implantation in porcine knee joints, the fine morphology, composition, phenotype, microstructure and mechanical properties of the regenerated hyaline-like cartilaginous neo-tissue have been demonstrated via histology, biochemical assays, DNA microarrays and mechanical tests. The articular cartilaginous engraftment with allogeneic dLhCG was indicated to be well consistent, compatible and integrated with the native cartilage of the host.

After 24 weeks the rabbits were killed and histological sections were subjected to semiquantitative and quantitative evaluation by observers blinded regarding treatment modality. High degree of filling was obtained, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments.

We describe regenerative medicine technologies, including cellular therapies, gene therapies and multimolecular preparations of growth factors and cytokines, which are expected to advance the field of orthopaedics and sports medicine. Gene therapy involves the introduction of genetic information in the injured tissue to help that tissue to heal and, possibly, regenerate. Cell therapies used in clinical practice are based on the transplantation of adult human cells, which can be at different stages of differentiation. Currently, the stromal vascular fraction, containing stem cells and other niche components, has been injected in the articular cartilage of the knee or delivered via arthroscopy. Bone marrow concentrate (BMC) has been used to manage focal chondral defects via arthroscopy with promising clinical results. In addition, purified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been injected or delivered as an adjuvant to arthroscopic microfractures, and patients have shown improved clinical outcomes. Laboratory-expanded MSCs injected in osteoarthritis moderately improved pain and functional outcomes. MSC treatment in the form of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or BMC or laboratory expanded adhesive cells (bone marrow and adipose derived stem cells, BM-MSCs and ADSCs) has been proven to be safe. Despite their safety, expensive regulatory complexities required to implement cell-based therapies make these treatments unavailable for most patients.

The untreated cartilage defects served as control. The tissue response was evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks after implantation by general histology and semi-quantitative histological grading systems. In addition, the repaired tissues were evaluated by mechanical test at 12 weeks after implantation. The MSCs-loaded collagen scaffold group showed the most hyaline cartilage, highest histological scores and compressive modulus. Moreover, it showed a good integration with the subchondral bone and adjacent cartilage.

Due to limited capability for self-regeneration, cartilage repair remains a challenge for the present-day orthopedics. Currently, available therapeutic methods fail to provide satisfactory results. A search for other strategies that could regenerate a hyaline-like tissue with a durable effect and adequate mechanical properties is underway. Tissue engineering strategies comprise the use of an appropriately chosen scaffold in combination with seeding cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) provide an interesting new option in regenerative medicine with solid preclinical data and first promising clinical results. They act not only through direct cartilage formation, but also due to paracrine effects, such as releasing trophic factors, anti-inflammatory cytokines, and promoting angiogenesis. The MSC can be applied in an allogeneic setting without eliciting a host immune response. Out of the various available sources, MSC derived from Wharton's jelly of an umbilical cord seem to have many advantages over their counterparts.

Due to the bradytrophic character of hyaline cartilage, these lesions are hardly repaired by the organism. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) was established for restoring isolated structural cartilage defects in knee joints. However, results are not always convincing. Human chondrocytes from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were cultured in monolayer followed by condensing single chondrocytes to spheroids (chondrospheres). The integrative capacity of chondrospheres was examined by implanting them into lesions in human articular cartilage specimens and co-implanting them into SCID mice. Mice were sacrificed after 4, 12 and 24 weeks. HE and safranin O staining as well as immunohistochemistry using anti-S100, anti-collagen I and II antibodies were performed and analyzed using semiquantitative scores. Integration of the chondrospheres with the (native) cartilage matrix was analyzed by determining the percentage of adhering surface. With respect to long-term stability, the chondrocytes within chondrospheres showed a typical chondrocytic morphology. Immunohistochemically, a high collagen II production was detected. Over a time period of 24 weeks, an increasing content of collagen type II, glycosaminoglycans and collagenous fibers were found. Importantly, the newly synthesized cartilaginous matrix integrated continuously with the native cartilage lesion border. In conclusion, the presented data demonstrate that chondrospheres are able to restore and conserve their phenotype for at least 24 weeks under in vivo conditions. Moreover, chondrospheres adhere to full-thickness cartilage defects and appear to produce a cartilaginous extracellular matrix which fuses with native cartilage thus generating an autologous cartilage-like repair tissue.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In this study, a strategy was proposed to utilize type II collagen (Col-II) gels with autologous bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) embedded to repair full-thickness chondral defects. Its feasibility and efficacy were further assessed in a minipig model. An 8-mm full-thickness chondral defect was created on the femoral trochlea of two knees in Guizhou minipigs. One knee received Col-II gels with BMDCs implantation versus the untreated one as control. After 1, 3, and 6 months operation, the animals were sacrificed, and the repair outcomes of chondral defects were evaluated using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), macro- and microscopic observation, and histological analysis. The treatment group showed significantly better repair outcomes of chondral defects than that in the control group at each time point (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the image showed that the repaired tissue in the treatment group was more similar to the surrounding healthy cartilage tissue. Based on the hyaline-like tissue regenerated ability, this one-step strategy provides a promising therapeutic potential for clinical application.",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Despite increasing interest in these MSCs, concerns regarding their safety, in vivo behavior and clinical effectiveness have restrained their clinical application. We hypothesized that MSCs have trophic effects that stimulate recycled chondrons (chondrocytes with their native pericellular matrix) to regenerate cartilage. Searching for a proof of principle, this phase I (first-in-man) clinical trial applied allogeneic MSCs mixed with either 10% or 20% recycled autologous cartilage-derived cells (chondrons) for treatment of cartilage defects in the knee in symptomatic cartilage defect patients. This unique first in man series demonstrated no treatment-related adverse events up to one year postoperatively. At 12 months, all patients showed statistically significant improvement in clinical outcome compared to baseline. Magnetic resonance imaging and second-look arthroscopies showed completely filled defects with regenerative cartilage tissue. Histological analysis on biopsies of the grafts indicated hyaline-like regeneration with a high concentration of proteoglycans and type II collagen. Short tandem repeat analysis showed the regenerative tissue only contained patient-own DNA. These findings support the novel insight that the use of allogeneic MSCs is safe and opens opportunities for other applications.

Because a functional interaction between cartilage and bone is crucial, the pathophysiology of OA and its treatment strategy must focus also on subchondral bone. We investigated whether adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) injected into a joint at two different concentrations could prevent subchondral bone damage after the onset of mild OA in a rabbit model. We measured both volumetric and densitometric aspects of bone remodeling. Although OA can stimulate bone remodeling either catabolically or anabolically over time, the accelerated turnover does not allow complete mineralization of new bone and therefore gradually reduces its density. We measured changes in morphometric and densitometric bone parameters using micro-CT analysis and correlated them with the corresponding parameters in cartilage and meniscus. We found that ASCs promoted cartilage repair and helped counteract the accelerated bone turnover that occurs with OA.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Design In vitro-Short- and long-term degradation scaffolds were seeded with culture expanded articular chondrocytes or bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Cell growth and differentiation were evaluated with cell morphological studies and gene expression studies. In vivo-A microfracture rat model was used in this study to evaluate the repair of cartilage and subchondral bone with the contralateral knee serving as the empty control. The treatment groups include (1) empty osteochondral defect, (2) polycaprolactone copolymer-based polyester polyurethane-urea (PSPU-U) caffold short-term degradative profile, and (3) PSPU-U scaffold long-term degradative profile. After placement of the scaffold, the rats were then allowed unrestricted activity as tolerated, and histological analyses were performed at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. The cartilage defect was measured and compared with the contralateral control side. Results In vitro-Long-term scaffolds showed statistically significant higher levels of aggrecan and type II collagen expression compared with short-term scaffolds. In vivo-Within 16 weeks postimplantation, there was new subchondral bone formation in both scaffolds. Short-term scaffolds had a statistically significant increase in defect filling and better qualitative histologic fill compared to control.

In an attempt to fulfill patients' expectations and successfully treat this pathology, various techniques have been developed over the years. Treatments proposed for cartilage lesions are described with their rationale and indications, ranging from conservative measures to surgical approaches, reparative or regenerative. Among the numerous and heterogeneous procedures proposed over time to treat cartilage defects none has clearly proven to lead to a hyaline articular surface nor to offer better clinical results. Regenerative procedures have been introduced as ambitious techniques that aim to overcome the limitations of the more traditional reparative approaches and restore the articular surface with a hyaline-like tissue; improvement in tissue engineering with new scaffolds as well as new regenerative options involving growth factors or MSCs are currently being investigated as promising solutions to further improve the treatment of cartilage lesions. However, the current literature findings are not conclusive. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate new regenerative approaches, to show clearly advantages and disadvantages with respect to the more traditional procedures, besides their potential, limits, and indications to improve the treatment of patients affected by chondral and osteochondral lesions. Since clear and commonly accepted treatment algorithms are not available in the literature, the massively increasing number of controversial results may be confusing for the orthopaedic surgeon who has to choose the proper management of patients with cartilage lesions. Thus, the results obtained through the study of the authors' 20 years' experience in cartilage treatment were analyzed to give some indications on the potential and limits of different treatment approaches available in clinical practice.",2013,Jeyaraman_2020,0

A novel PLGA-gelatin/chondroitin/hyaluronate (PLGA-GCH) hybrid scaffold with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-impregnated microspheres (MS-TGF) was fabricated to mimic the extracellular matrix. MS-TGF showed an initial burst release (22.5%) and a subsequent moderate one that achieved 85.1% on day 21. MSCs seeded on PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF or PLGA-GCH were incubated in vitro and showed that PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF significantly augmented proliferation of MSCs and glycosaminoglycan synthesis compared with PLGA-GCH. Then MSCs seeded on PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF were implanted and differentiated in vivo to repair chondral defect on the right knee of rabbit (in vivo differentiation repair group), while the contralateral defect was repaired with in vitro differentiated MSCs seeded on PLGA-GCH (in vitro differentiation repair group). The histology observation demonstrated that in vivo differentiation repair showed better chondrocyte morphology, integration, and subchondral bone formation compared with in vitro differentiation repair 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively, although there was no significant difference after 6 weeks. The histology grading score comparison also demonstrated the same results. The present study implies that in vivo differentiation induced by PLGA-GCH/MS-TGF and the host microenviroment could keep chondral phenotype and enhance repair.

Successful reports have usually involved the seeding of autologous chondrocytes into polymers. Problems arise because of the scarcity of cartilage tissue biopsy material, and because the in vitro expansion of chondrocytes is difficult; to some extent, these problems limit the clinical application of this promising method. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been proved a potential cell source because of their in vitro proliferation ability and multilineage differentiation capacity. However, in vitro differentiation will lead to high cost and always results in decreased cell viability. In this study we seeded culture-expanded autologous MSCs into bioceramic scaffold-beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) in an attempt to repair articular cartilage defects (8 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth) in a sheep model. Twenty-four weeks later, the defects were resurfaced with hyaline-like tissue and an ideal interface between the engineered cartilage, the adjacent normal cartilage, and the underlying bone was observed. From 12 to 24 weeks postimplantation, modification of neocartilage was obvious in the rearrangement of surface cartilage and the increase in glycosaminoglycan level.

MSCs, which were obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat and cultivated, were injected into normal SD rats in which multiple tissues had been injured including anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial meniscus, and articular cartilage of the femoral condyles. At 4 weeks after injection of MSCs, fluorescent microscopic observation, immunohistochemical or histological examinations were performed to evaluate mobilization of MSCs into injured tissue and their contribution to tissue regeneration. In the group of 1 x 10(6) MSCs injection, GFP positive cells could mobilize into the injured ACL alone in all 8 knees.

Cartilage repair techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation, matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation, osteochondral autograft transfer, microfracture, and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) have all been suggested to restore joint congruity and minimize further chondral deterioration. However, chondrocyte implantation techniques and osteochondral grafts are technically challenging in the hip because of its constrained nature, and many cell-based therapies have shown suboptimal results near the chondrolabral junction because of the increased shear forces at the peripheral acetabulum and increased stress at the weight-bearing region of the joint. By using BMAC to augment labral repairs and coat chondrolabral junction breakdown, we are able to introduce mesenchymal stem cells to peripheral acetabular tissue with little to no drawbacks, while avoiding donor-site morbidity, open procedures, and multiple surgeries.

We investigated the utility of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles to promote controlled bone-growth across the bone-cartilage interface in an in vitro engineered tissue model system using bone marrow derived stem cells. Samples incorporated with HA demonstrated significantly higher interfacial shear strength (at the junction between engineered cartilage and engineered bone) compared with the constructs without HA (p < 0.05), after 28 days of culture. Interestingly, this increased interfacial shear strength due to the presence of HA was observed as early as 7 days and appeared to have sustained itself for an additional three weeks without interacting with strength increases attributable to subsequent secretion of engineered tissue matrix. Histological evidence showed that there was ∼7.5% bone in-growth into the cartilage region from the bone side. The mechanism of enhanced engineered cartilage to bone integration with HA incorporation appeared to be facilitated by the deposition of calcium phosphate in the transition zone.

An idealized finite element model of the medial compartment of the knee was created, including a circular defect and an osteochondral implant. Damage and failure of fibrin at the interface was represented by a cohesive zone model with coefficients determined from an inverse finite element method and previously published experimental data. Our results demonstrated that fibrin glue alone may not be strong enough to withstand physiologic loads in vivo while fibrin glue combined with chondrocytes more effectively prevents damage at the interface. The results of this study suggest that fibrin fails mainly in shear during off-axis loading and that adhesive materials that are stronger or more compliant than fibrin may be good alternatives due to decreased failure at the interface. The present model may be used to improve design and testing protocols of bioadhesives and give insight into the failure mechanisms of cartilage implant fixation in the knee joint.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Twenty-three patients who received intra-articular CBMA injection in combination with polyurethane-based medial meniscus scaffold implantation were evaluated within the scope of this study. The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) questionnaire and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were used to evaluate the results, and the visual analog scale was used to assess the pain scores. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in the preoperative period and at postoperative months 1, 12, 24, and 36 to assess the scaffold position as well as chondral degeneration/damage in a comparative manner. MRI assessment was performed by using the modified Outerbridge scale for cartilage and the Genovese scoring system for the meniscal implant. Twenty-three patients who were included in the study were evaluated for a mean follow-up period of 38.3 months. Patients exhibited statistically significant improvement according to all scoring data from the preoperative period until the follow-up period. The mean postoperative extrusion at year 3 was 2.39 mm (distribution 2.30-2.56 mm). There was no significant difference in the distribution of the degree of chondral damage between the preoperative and 3-year follow-up periods.

They are commonly associated with ligament injuries but also may be frequently isolated. Increasing awareness and advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to increasing diagnosis and recognition of these injuries. Articular cartilage is just 2 to 4 mm thick and is avascular, alymphatic, and aneural. It has a limited capacity for healing, and there has been increasing use of cartilage repair techniques to treat these lesions in the active population. Strategies for cartilage repair include marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture/drilling, osteochondral grafting, and autologous chondrocyte transplants. MRI is an important tool in the diagnosis and grading of cartilage injury and is useful in the follow-up and monitoring of these repair procedures. It is important for radiologists and clinicians to be aware of the capabilities and limitations of MRI in assessing cartilage injury and to be familiar with common postsurgical appearances to facilitate assessment and follow-up in this population.

The porous PLGA-GCH scaffold was developed to mimic the natural extra cellular matrix of cartilage. The differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded on PLGA-GCH or PLGA scaffold were incubated in vitro and showed that, compared to PLGA scaffold, the PLGA-GCH scaffold significantly augmented the proliferation of MSCs and GAG synthesis. Then autologous differentiated MSCs/PLGA-GCH was implanted to repair full-thickness cartilage defect in rabbit, while MSCs/PLGA for the contra lateral cartilage defect (n=30). Fifteen additional rabbits without treatment for defects were used as control. Histology observation showed the MSCs/PLGA-GCH repair group had better chondrocyte morphology, integration, continuous subchondral bone, and much thicker newly formed cartilage compared with MSCs/PLGA repair group 12 and 24 weeks postoperatively. There was a significant difference in histological grading score between these two groups, which both showed much better repair than control.

Because it is impossible to include observations on all the published articles in one review, our attempt is to highlight Asian progress in this area during recent years (2005 to the present), reviewing research development and clinical studies. In the former, our discussion of in vitro studies focuses on (1) potential sources of stem cells--such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from marrow, cord blood, synovium, and mobilized peripheral blood--which are capable of enhancing cartilage repair and (2) the use of growth factors and scaffolds with and without cells. Our discussion of animal studies attempts to summarize activities in evaluating surgical procedures and determining the route of cell administration, as well as studies on matrices and scaffolds. It ranges from the use of small animals such as rats and rabbits to larger animals like pigs and dogs. The local adherent technique, enhancement of microfracture with poly(l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) scaffold, adenovirus-mediated bone morphogenic protein (BMP) genes, and MSCs--whether they are magnetically labeled, suspended in hyaluronic acid, or immobilized with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)--have all been able to engineer a repair of the osteochondral defect. Although published Asian reports of clinical studies on cartilage repair are few, the findings of relevant trials are summarized in our discussion of these investigations. There has been a long history of use of laboratory-derived MSCs for cartilage repair. Recent progress has suggested the potential utility of cord blood and mobilized peripheral blood in this area, as well as more injectable bone marrow (BM)-derived stem cells.

For the definition of pertinent variables the repair tissue of 45 patients treated with three different techniques for cartilage repair (microfracture, autologous osteochondral transplantation, and autologous chondrocyte transplantation) was analyzed 6 and 12 months after the procedure. High-resolution imaging was obtained with a surface phased array coil placed over the knee compartment of interest and adapted sequences were used on a 1 T MRI scanner. The analysis of the repair tissue included the definition and rating of nine pertinent variables: the degree of filling of the defect, the integration to the border zone, the description of the surface and structure, the signal intensity, the status of the subchondral lamina and subchondral bone, the appearance of adhesions and the presence of synovitis. High-resolution MRI, using a surface phased array coil and specific sequences, can be used on every standard 1 or 1.5 T MRI scanner according to the in-house standard protocols for knee imaging in patients who have had cartilage repair procedures without substantially prolonging the total imaging time.

17235008,Postoperative evaluation of the knee after autologous chondrocyte implantation: what radiologists need to know.,"Yvonne Yiwan Ho, Anthony Joseph Stanley, James Hoi-Po Hui, Shih-Chang Wang","Articular cartilage lesions occur commonly. Cartilage is relatively avascular and is unable to self-repair. A chondral lesion may become symptomatic. It may lead to osteoarthritis and increased morbidity. The aim of cartilage repair is to restore hyaline cartilage. There are many types of cartilage repair surgery, most of which result in fibrocartilage repair tissue that is suboptimal. Autologous chondrocyte implantation has been shown to produce hyaline-type repair tissue. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is performed preoperatively to define the ulcer and postoperatively to evaluate the technical success of implantation and the state of cartilage healing and to identify potential complications. Features of the autologous chondrocyte implantation graft that are assessed include the degree of filling by repair tissue, its integration with native cartilage and subchondral bone, the character of the graft substance and surface, and the underlying bone. MR arthrography is superior to unenhanced MR imaging because intraarticular contrast material allows the recipient site to be physically separated from adjacent structures so that it can be characterized more accurately. MR imaging and arthroscopy are complementary investigations in the follow-up of an autologous chondrocyte implantation in the knee. The appearance of the knee after autologous chondrocyte implantation varies among individuals and according to the time-course of healing.

Our aim is to evaluate the mid- and long-term functional outcome of the treatment of osteochondral defects of the knee with autologous osteochondral transplantation with the OATS technique. Thirty-six patients (37 procedures) were included in this study. Twenty-three patients were male and thirteen were female with a mean age of 31.9 years (range: 18-48 years). The cause of the defect was OCD in 10 cases, AVN in 2, lateral patellar maltracking in 7, while in the remaining 17 patients the defect was post-traumatic. The lesion was located on the femoral condyles in 26 cases and the patellofemoral joint in the remaining 11. The average area covered was 2.73 cm(2) (range: 0.8-12 cm(2)) and patients were followed for an average of 36.9 months (range: 18-73 months). The average score in their Tegner Activity Scale was 3.76 (range: 1-8), while their score in Activities of Daily Living Scale of the Knee Outcome Survey ranged from 18 to 98 with an average of 72.3. Thirty-two out of 37 patients (86.5%) reported improvement of their pre-operative symptoms. All but 5 patients returned to their previous occupation while 18 went back to sports. No correlation was found between patient age at operation, the size or site of the chondral lesion and the functional outcome. We believe that autologous osteochondral grafting with the OATS technique is a safe and successful treatment option for focal osteochondral defects of the knee. It offers a very satisfactory functional outcome and does not compromise the patient's future options.",2006,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Osteochondral autograft and allograft reconstruction of these lesions has been used extensively; however, these techniques often require a more invasive surgical exposure, and restoring the natural articular surface radius of curvature can be challenging, particularly in larger lesions. Cell-based repair of these lesions, using autologous chondrocytes in conjunction with bone grafting, has been used with success, although this procedure requires the patient to undergo 2 operations, and access is often restricted due to the high associated costs. Comparable medium-term clinical outcomes have been shown with scaffold-associated mesenchymal stem cell grafting, and this cell-based procedure may also be performed arthroscopically to minimize patient morbidity. In cases of cartilage injury associated with bone loss, this procedure has great potential to repair osteochondral injury when used in conjunction with bone grafting.

Repair for massive meniscal defect remains a challenge owing to a lack of cell kinetics for the menisci precursors in knee joint. The synovium plays pivotal roles during the natural course of meniscal healing and contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with high chondrogenic potential. Here, we investigated whether intra-articular injected synovium-MSCs enhanced meniscal regeneration in rat massive meniscal defect. To track the injected cells, we developed transgenic rats expressing dual luciferase (Luc) and LacZ. The cells derived from synovium of the rats demonstrated colony-forming ability and multipotentiality, both characteristics of MSCs. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that gene expression of meniscal cells was closer to that of synovium-MSCs than to that of bone marrow-MSCs. Two to 8 weeks after five million Luc/LacZ+ synovium-MSCs were injected into massive meniscectomized knee of wild-type rat, macroscopically, the menisci regenerated much better than it did in the control group. After 12 weeks, the regenerated menisci were LacZ positive, produced type 2 collagen, and showed meniscal features by transmission electron microscopy. In in-vivo luminescence analysis, photons increased in the meniscus-resected knee over a 3-day period, then decreased without detection in all other organs. LacZ gene derived from MSCs could not be detected in other organs except in synovium by real-time PCR. Synovium-MSCs injected into the massive meniscectomized knee adhered to the lesion, differentiated into meniscal cells directly, and promoted meniscal regeneration without mobilization to distant organs.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In this study, we investigated the characteristics and potential of human CSPCs combined with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) scaffolds to induce osteochondral regeneration in rabbit knees. We isolated CSPCs from human adult articular cartilage undergoing total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. We characterized CSPCs and compared them with infrapatellar fat pad-derived stem cells (IFPs) in a colony formation assay and by multilineage differentiation analysis in vitro. We further evaluated the osteochondral regeneration of the CSPC-loaded PLGA scaffold during osteochondral defect repair in rabbits. The characteristics of CSPCs were similar to those of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and exhibited chondrogenic and osteogenic phenotypes without chemical induction. For in vivo analysis, CSPC-loaded PLGA scaffolds produced a hyaline-like cartilaginous tissue, which showed good integration with the host tissue and subchondral bone. Furthermore, CSPCs migrated in response to injury to promote subchondral bone regeneration. Overall, we demonstrated that CSPCs can promote osteochondral regeneration.

This technique aims to augment the original single-stage procedure with a number of mesenchymal stem cells and growth factors contained in the BMC, to increase the defect filling and the rate of hyaline-like cartilage regeneration. The procedure combining MFX, BMC, and a protective scaffold is inexpensive and reproducible and has already shown the ability to regenerate hyaline-like cartilage. Its use as an alternative to autologous chondrocyte implantation requires further investigation.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

However, most studies focused on focal cartilage defect through surgical implantation. For the treatment of generalized cartilage loss in osteoarthritis, an alternative delivery strategy would be more appropriate. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of intra-articular injection of autologous adipose tissue derived MSCs (AD-MSCs) for knee osteoarthritis. We enrolled 18 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee and injected AD MSCs into the knee. The phase I study consists of three dose-escalation cohorts; the low-dose (1.0 × 10(7) cells), mid-dose (5.0 × 10(7)), and high-dose (1.0 × 10(8)) group with three patients each. The phase II included nine patients receiving the high-dose. The primary outcomes were the safety and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included clinical, radiological, arthroscopic, and histological evaluations. There was no treatment-related adverse event. The WOMAC score improved at 6 months after injection in the high-dose group. The size of cartilage defect decreased while the volume of cartilage increased in the medial femoral and tibial condyles of the high-dose group. Arthroscopy showed that the size of cartilage defect decreased in the medial femoral and medial tibial condyles of the high-dose group. Histology demonstrated thick, hyaline-like cartilage regeneration. These results showed that intra-articular injection of 1.0 × 10(8) AD MSCs into the osteoarthritic knee improved function and pain of the knee joint without causing adverse events, and reduced cartilage defects by regeneration of hyaline-like articular cartilage.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

However, there is no systematic information for the efficacy of the new generation ACI techniques compared to other treatment options. A systematic review of the existing evidence from randomized clinical trials of ACI treatment would contribute to understanding the advantages and limitations of this method and would inform the planning of future studies. Using pre-defined criteria, we searched a number of electronic databases to identify all the existing randomized control trials of any type of ACI treatment. Risk of bias was assessed and an analysis of the reported outcomes was performed. Information on the clinical efficacy and safety of ACI compared to other interventions was collected and presented. Nine trials were identified with 626 patients. Patients ranged from 15 to 52 years, and the size of treated lesions was between 1 and 22 cm(2). ACI was associated with improvement in clinical outcomes compared to baseline. However, the body of evidence did not suggest any superiority of ACI over other treatments. Complication rates were comparable between interventions except from an increased rate of graft hypertrophies after ACI with periosteum. ACI is an effective treatment for full thickness chondral defects of the knee, providing an improvement of clinical outcomes. However, there is insufficient data to say whether ACI is superior to other treatment strategies. More high quality studies and harmonization in the reported outcomes are needed before specific suggestions for practice can be made.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Fibrin ACI is a new tissue-engineering technique for the treatment of full-thickness articular cartilage defects, in which autologous chondrocytes are inserted into a three-dimensional scaffold provided by fibrin gel. The objective of this study is to document and compare mean changes in overall clinical scores at both baseline and follow-up. Fibrin ACI was used to treat deep cartilage defects of the femoral condyle in 30 patients. There were 24 men and 6 women with a median age of 35 years (range 15-55) and with a mean defect size of 5.8 cm(2) (range 2.3-12). Clinical and functional knee evaluations were performed using different scoring systems, MRI was performed 24 months postoperatively, and arthroscopy was performed 12 months postoperatively. All patients achieved clinical and functional status improvements following surgery (P < 0.01). The mean scores of the Henderson classification (MRI evaluation) significantly improved from 14.4 to 7 (P = 0.001), and no graft-associated complications were noted. Arthroscopic assessments performed 12 months postoperatively produced nearly normal (grade II) International Cartilage Repair Society scores in 8 of the 10 study patients.

MRI has become the method of choice for non-invasive follow-up of patients after cartilage repair surgery. It should be performed with cartilage sensitive sequences, including fat-suppressed proton density-weighted T2 fast spin-echo (PD/T2-FSE) and three-dimensional gradient-echo (3D GRE) sequences, which provide good signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. A thorough magnetic resonance (MR)-based assessment of cartilage repair tissue includes evaluations of defect filling, the surface and structure of repair tissue, the signal intensity of repair tissue and the subchondral bone status. Furthermore, in osteochondral autografts surface congruity, osseous incorporation and the donor site should be assessed. High spatial resolution is mandatory and can be achieved either by using a surface coil with a 1.5-T scanner or with a knee coil at 3 T; it is particularly important for assessing graft morphology and integration. Moreover, MR imaging facilitates assessment of complications including periosteal hypertrophy, delamination, adhesions, surface incongruence and reactive changes such as effusions and synovitis. Ongoing developments include isotropic 3D sequences, for improved morphological analysis, and in vivo biochemical imaging such as dGEMRIC, T2 mapping and diffusion-weighted imaging, which make functional analysis of cartilage possible.",2007,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In this study, we combined a high-resolution cartilage-sensitive fast-spin echo (FSE) sequence with intravenous application of a contrast agent for enhancing synovial fluid. Two independent musculoskeletal radiologists interpreted the pictures for the thickness, length and surface of the cartilage implants. A multivariate two-way analysis of variance with two repeated measures was performed and showed that evaluation of cartilage implant morphology was significantly improved after the application of gadodiamide on proton density FSE images.

Here, we report two first-in-man cases (patient A and B) treated with combined autologous chondrocyte and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell implantation (CACAMI), with 8-year follow up. Two patients with International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III-IV cartilage lesions underwent a co-implantation of autologous chondrocytes and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) between February 2008 and October 2009. In brief, chondrocytes and BM-MSCs were separately isolated and culture-expanded in a good manufacturing practice laboratory for a period of 2-4 weeks. Cells were then implanted in combination into cartilage defects and patients were clinically evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively, using the self-reported Lysholm knee score and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Postoperative Lysholm scores were compared with the Oswestry risk of knee arthroplasty (ORKA) scores. Patient A also had a second-look arthroscopy, at which time a biopsy of the repair site was taken. Both patients demonstrated a significant long-term improvement in knee function, with postoperative Lysholm scores being consistently higher than ORKA predictions. The most recent Lysholm scores, 8 years after surgery were 100/100 (Patient A) and 88/100 (Patient B), where 100 represents a fully functioning knee joint. Bone marrow lesion (BML) volume was shown to decrease on postoperative MRIs in both patients. Cartilage defect area increased in patient A, but declined initially for patient B, slightly increasing again 2 years after treatment. The repair site biopsy taken from patient A at 14 months postoperatively, demonstrated a thin layer of fibrocartilage covering the treated defect site.

Most of these use scaffolds to achieve sufficient thickness. However, considering the potential influence of scaffolds on the surrounding microenvironment, as well as immunological issues, it is desirable to develop a scaffold-free technique. In this study, we developed a novel technique, a scaffold-free autologous construct derived from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), and successfully use this technique to regenerate cartilage and subchondral bone to repair an osteochondral defect in rabbit knees.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0
16144442,Autologous chondrocyte implantation with collagen bioscaffold for the treatment of osteochondral defects in rabbits.,"C Willers, J Chen, D Wood, J Xu, M H Zheng","Osteochondral injury is therapeutically irreversible within current treatment parameters. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) promises to regenerate hyaline articular cartilage, but conventional ACI is plagued by complications determined by periosteal grafting. Here we propose the utilization of collagen membrane in ACI as an effective bioscaffold for the regeneration of osteochondral lesions. Using a rabbit model of osteochondral injury, we have inoculated autologous chondrocytes onto a type I/III collagen scaffold [so-called matrix-induced ACI (MACI)] and implanted into 3-mm osteochondral knee defects. All untreated defect histology showed inferior fibrocartilage and/or fibrous tissue repair. In our time-course study, ACI with type I/III collagen membrane regenerated cartilage with healthy osteochondral architecture in osteochondral defects at 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, articular cartilage regeneration was maintained, with reduced thickness and proteoglycan compared with the adjacent cartilage. Both 6-week (p < 0.01) and 12-week (p < 0.05) ACI with collagen membrane showed significant improvement as compared with untreated controls. To further examine the efficacy of cartilage regeneration by ACI, we conducted a dose-response study, using chondrocytes at various cell densities between 10(4) and 10(6) cells/cm(2). The results showed that cell density had no effect on outcome histology, but all cell densities were significantly better than untreated controls (p < 0.01) and cell-free collagen membrane treatment (p < 0.05). In short, our data suggest that autologous chondrocyte-seeded type I/III collagen membrane is an effective method for the treatment of focal osteochondral knee injury in rabbits.",2005,Jeyaraman_2020,0

27340515,The Challenge and the Promise of Bone Marrow Cells for Human Cartilage Repair.,Constance R Chu,"The cartilage repair potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells has been well described. Harnessing this potential for human articular cartilage repair remains challenging. Accessing bone marrow repair cells through marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture is readily achieved with generally good but inconsistent results. Animal and human studies show feasibility for ex vivo processing of bone marrow to isolate, concentrate, and culture mesenchymal stem cells. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement using bone marrow cell preparations above what has been achieved with microfracture. Consequently, microfracture continues to be the simplest and most commonly used method to enhance repair of focal articular cartilage defects. Emerging preclinical work in the equine model suggests a role for enhancing marrow-stimulation techniques through the use of natural scaffolds such as autologous platelet enriched fibrin as well as optimization of joint biology through localized gene therapy to support cartilage repair. In contrast to joint replacement where inert materials of known mechanical properties are used, host biology determines the relative success, failure, and durability of cartilage repair. As such, development of personalized strategies to improve the quality and durability of bone marrow cell-based articular cartilage repair represent exciting new areas of inquiry. Continued advances in stem cell biology, scaffold technologies, and methods to delineate and enhance host biology, both systemically and within the joint, hold promise for harnessing the full power of bone marrow cells to facilitate cartilage repair and regeneration.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Cultured chondrocytes are seeded on a collagen membrane that can be implanted into the defect using exclusively fibrin glue. These features imply some surgical advantages with respect to the traditional ACI technique, such as the possibility of performing the procedure in articular sites, in which putting stitches for the periosteal patch is impossible. We report on the arthroscopic MACI technique for the treatment of a chondral defect of the knee. A 25-year-old man suffered persistent pain at the left knee after a violent direct trauma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arthroscopic examination at the time of cartilage biopsy revealed a 2-cm2 chondral lesion in the posterior portion of the lateral tibial plateau. The implantation procedure was performed through traditional arthroscopic portals, and the seeded membrane was fixed with fibrin glue, excluding water flow temporarily. Implant stability was verified intraoperatively, and filling of the defect was shown 12 months after surgery by MRI, which showed a hyaline-like cartilage signal. In this specific case, the arthroscopic approach allowed to achieve an optimal view of the lesion, without sacrificing any tendinous or ligamentous structure of the knee.",2004,Jeyaraman_2020,0

This third-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) technique improves on the limitations of previous methods, including the risk of uneven chondrocyte distribution at the time of implantation and graft hypertrophy. Given the compliant properties of the scaffold, the graft can be easily shaped to treat irregular chondral defects and applied to articular surfaces with multiplanar geometry (e.g., patella, trochlea). Although ACI techniques are ideally suited to treat chondral surface defects, the ACI ""sandwich"" technique can be used to treat large osteochondral defects with significant bone loss (>8 mm). Historically, this procedure uses autologous bone graft to replace areas of osseous deficiency along with 2 type I/III collagen bilayer membranes to securely contain the cultured chondrocytes within the defect.

Damage can insidiously spread and lead to osteoarthritis with significant functional and socioeconomic consequences. Implants consisting of autologous chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) seeded onto scaffolds have been suggested as promising therapies to restore these defects. However, the degree of integration between the implant and native cartilage still requires optimization. A PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted using five databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL) to identify studies that used autologous chondrocyte implants (ACI) or MSC implant therapies to repair chondral defects of the tibiofemoral joint. Data on the integration of the implant-cartilage interface, as well as outcomes of clinical scoring systems, were extracted. Most eligible studies investigated the use of ACI only.

Bone marrow-derived MSCs are pluripotent cells that can differentiate among others into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes.Bone marrow-derived cells may represent the future in osteochondral repair. A one-step arthroscopic technique is developed for cartilage repair, using a device to concentrate bone marrow-derived cells and collagen powder or hyaluronic acid membrane as scaffolds for cell support and platelet gel.The rationale of the ""one-step technique"" is to transplant the entire bone-marrow cellular pool instead of isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells allowing cells to be processed directly in the operating room, without the need for a laboratory phase. For an entirely arthroscopic implantation are employed a scaffold and the instrumentation previously applied for ACI; in addition to these devices, autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) is added in order to provide a supplement of growth factors.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A rabbit model (n=16) and a minipig model (n=8) of cartilage repair were created with cartilage defects of the knee joints treated with bone marrow stimulation (BMS). In the ECM group, autologous bone MSC-derived ECM scaffolds were implanted into the cartilage defects after bone marrow stimulation. In the BMS group, the cartilage defects were treated by bone marrow stimulation only. The renewal capacity of bone MSCs was measured with a colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) in vitro assay. The extent of cartilage repair was as-sessed at 6 months after surgery. RESULTS In the rabbit model, the macroscopic appearance of the exudate of the healing wounds in the ECM group showed less fibrosis, and the histology showed more evenly distributed chondrocytes compared with the BMS group. The CFU-F assay showed that the number of bone MSCs in the ECM group was approximately was twice that of the BMS group. In the minipig model, the macroscopic appearance and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the ECM group were improved when compared with the BMS group. The repaired tissue in ECM group had similar histological characteristics and biochemical content to normal hyaline cartilage.

The goal of this study was to investigate the retention, adhesion, proliferation, and cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) production of marrow clot-derived cells within a bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived (BMSC-d) ECM/marrow clot composite scaffold. We fabricated BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffolds and kept them in chondrogenic medium in vitro for 1, 3, or 6 weeks. Unmodified marrow clots were used as a control. The BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold exhibited a porous structure suitable for cell attachment and growth and further maintained cell viability. The DNA content measurements revealed that more cells proliferated in the BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffolds over time than in the marrow clots. Furthermore, the histologic, immunohistochemical, and western blot results demonstrated that the BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold produced more hyaline-like cartilage and less fibrocartilage than the marrow clot in culture. Taken together, these findings indicate that the porous BMSC-dECM/marrow clot composite scaffold promotes the retention, attachment, and proliferation of cells from the marrow clot, and thus can stabilize the marrow clot to support chondrogenesis.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Improvement in mean subjective score from preoperative (37.6) to 12 months (56.4) and 24 (60.1) months post-ACI were observed. Knee function levels also improved [86% International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) III/IV to 66.6% I/II] from preoperative period to 24 months postimplantation. Objective IKDC score of A or B were observed in 88% preoperatively. This decreased to 67.9% at 3 months before improving to 92.5% at 12 months and 94.4% at 24 months post implantation. Transient deterioration in all these clinical scores was observed at 3 months before progressive improvement became evident. MRI studies demonstrated 75.3% with at least 50% defect fill, 46.3% with near normal signal, 68.1% with mild/no effusion and also 66.7% with mild/no underlying bone marrow oedema at 3 months.

Current clinical options are able to alleviate patient suffering, but cannot sufficiently regenerate the lost tissue. Biomimetic scaffolds that recapitulate the important features of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage are hypothesized to be advantageous in supporting cell growth, chondrogenic differentiation, and integration of regenerated cartilage with native cartilage, ultimately restoring the injured tissue to its normal function. It remains a challenge to support and maintain articular cartilage regenerated by bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), which are prone to hypertrophy and endochondral ossification after implantation in vivo. In the present work, a nanofibrous poly(l-lactic acid) (NF PLLA) scaffold developed by our group was utilized because of the desired highly porous structure, high interconnectivity, and collagen-like NF architecture to support rabbit BMSCs for articular cartilage regeneration. We further hypothesized that matrilin-3 (MATN3), a non-collagenous, cartilage-specific ECM protein, would enhance the microenvironment of the NF PLLA scaffold for cartilage regeneration and maintain the cartilage property. To test this hypothesis, we seeded BMSCs on the NF PLLA scaffold with or without MATN3. We found that MATN3 suppresses hypertrophy in this 3D culture system in vitro. Subcutaneous implantation of the chondrogenic cell/scaffold constructs in a nude mouse model showed that pretreatment with MATN3 was able to maintain chondrogenesis and prevent hypertrophy and endochondral ossification in vivo. These results demonstrate that the porous NF PLLA scaffold treated with MATN3 represents an advantageous 3D microenvironment for cartilage regeneration and phenotype maintenance, and is a promising strategy for articular cartilage repair.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

No significant differences were found between biomaterials loaded with stem cells and those loaded with somatic cells. Culture conditions of cells did not affect cartilage regeneration. Cartilage formation was reduced with adipose-derived stem cells compared to other cell types, but still improved compared to acellular scaffolds. Assessment of the risk of bias was impaired due to incomplete reporting for most studies.

The use of tissue-engineered grafts based on scaffolds seems to be as effective as conventional ACI clinically. However, there is limited evidence that scaffold techniques result in homogeneous distribution of cells. Similarly, few studies exist on the maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype in scaffolds. Both of which would be potential advantages over the first generation ACI. The mean clinical score in all of the clinical literature on scaffold techniques significantly improved compared with preoperative values. More than 80% of patients had an excellent or good outcome. None of the short- or mid-term clinical and histological results of these tissue-engineering techniques with scaffolds were reported to be better than conventional ACI. However, some studies suggest that these methods may reduce surgical time, morbidity, and risks of periosteal hypertrophy and post-operative adhesions. Based on the available literature, we were not able to rank the scaffolds available for clinical use. Firm recommendations on which cartilage repair procedure is to be preferred is currently not known on the basis of these studies. Randomized clinical trials and longer follow-up periods are needed for more widespread information regarding the clinical effectiveness of scaffold-based, tissue-engineered cartilage repair.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Although some epidemiological data suggest that incidence is associated with first-generation ACI using autologous chondrocyte implantation, it has also been reported in other technical modifications of ACI using different biomaterials. Nevertheless, it has not been described in autologous, non-periosteum, implant-free associated ACI. In addition, little is known about histological and T2-relaxation appearance of graft hypertrophy. The present case report provides a rare case of extensive graft hypertrophy following ACI using an autologous spheres technique with clinical progression over time. Detailed clinical, MR tomographic and histological evaluation has been performed, which demonstrates a high quality of repair tissue within the hypertrophic as well as non-hypertrophic transplanted areas of the repair tissue. No expression of collagen type X (a sign of chondrocyte hypertrophy), only slight changes of the subchondral bone and a nearly normal cell-matrix ratio suggest that tissue within the hypertrophic area does not significantly differ from intact and high-quality repair tissue and therefore seems not to cause graft hypertrophy. This is in contrast to the assumption that histological hypertrophy might cause or contribute to an overwhelming growth of the repair tissue within the transplantation site. Data presented in this manuscript might contribute to further explain the etiology of graft hypertrophy following ACI.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Totally 54 rabbits were randomly assigned to BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold, SF/CS scaffold and control groups. A cylindrical defect was created at the patellofemoral facet of the right knee of each rabbit and repaired by scaffold respectively. Samples were prepared at 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-surgery for gross observation, hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining, type II collagen immunohistochemistry, Wakitani histology. The results showed that differentiated BMSCs proliferated well in the scaffold. In the BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold group, the bone defect was nearly repaired, the scaffold was absorbed and immunohistochemistry was positive. In the SF/CS scaffold alone group, fiber-like tissues were observed, the scaffold was nearly degraded and immunohistochemistry was weakly positive. In the control group, the defect was not well repaired and positive immunoreactions were not detected. Modified Wakitani scores were superior in the BMSCs + SF/CS scaffold group compared with those in other groups at 4, 8 and 12 weeks (P < 0.05).

32624127,Editorial Commentary: Third-Generation Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation-Are Cells Seeded Onto the Scaffold Itself in It for the Long Run?,Christopher L McCrum,"Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is an increasingly performed procedure, with rapidly evolving technology. First-generation ACI used a periosteal patch, leading to the second generation, in which a type I-type III collagen membrane is used to cover the autologous chondrocytes, and ultimately the third generation, in which autologous chondrocytes are seeded onto the scaffold itself. As third-generation, scaffold-based ACI techniques are becoming more widely available, interest in the long-term clinical and radiographic outcomes continues to grow, especially given the high costs associated with these procedures. Several studies have now shown persistently improved clinical outcomes at long-term follow-up, which support the increasing utilization of third-generation ACI techniques. However, it is important to continue to develop our understanding of the limitations of and expectations with third-generation ACI, particularly regarding reoperation, as well as to continue to design high-quality long-term studies that can evaluate differences in technology.",2020,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation (MACT) with the use of biomaterials as cell carriers has facilitated operative application and fixation within the lesion. We have gained experience in the use of two different MACT techniques. According to the Hannover scoring system for the ankle and visual analog scores, results improved significantly (p<or=0.001) after MACT with the Hyalograft C in nine ankles at a mean follow-up of 3.7 years (range 2.6-4.8 years). All patients had undergone prior operative treatment for the cartilage lesion. Two patients were rated as excellent and seven as good. According to the ICRS cartilage repair assessment score, the transplanted areas were rated nearly normal (grade II) in seven patients who underwent undergone repeat arthroscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that in the majority of cases, filling of the defect was accomplished with a nonhomogeneous surface and structure of the graft. The use of a purely arthroscopically applicable three-dimensional MACT (ARTROcell 3D) with chondrospheres further facilitates the process and reduces operative morbidity. We have included eight patients in a prospective study so far. Six patients had undergone prior operative treatment for the cartilage lesion. In two cases, culturing of the cells failed for unexplained reasons; therefore, only six patients finally received the MACT with chondrospheres, and only four patients were evaluated at a 6-month follow-up examination. Thus, valid results cannot be reported. In revision cases, MACT is suggested to be a reliable alternative for treating articular cartilage lesions of the talus, but longer-term results in more patients remain to be evaluated.",2008,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Meanwhile, non-invasive imaging techniques were use to track SPIO-labeled MSCs by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Human bone marrow MSCs were cultured and labeled with SPIO. Fresh degenerated human osteochondral fragments were obtained during total knee arthroplasty and a cartilage defect was created at the center. Then, the osteochondral fragments were attached to the sidewalls of culture flasks filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to mimic the human joint cavity. The SPIO-labeled MSCs were injected into the culture flasks in the presence of a 0.57 Tesla (T) magnetic force. Before and 90 min after cell targeting, the specimens underwent T2-weighted turbo spin-echo (SET2WI) sequence of 3.0 T MRI. MRI results were compared with histological findings. Macroscopic observation showed that SPIO-labeled MSCs were steered to the target region of cartilage defect. MRI revealed significant changes in signal intensity (P<0.01). HE staining exibited that a great number of MSCs formed a three-dimensional (3D) cell ""sheet"" structure at the chondral defect site.

For this purpose suitable biocompatible scaffolds are needed to provide cell retention, chondrogenesis and initial mechanical stability. The present study should indicate whether a recently developed highly porous alginate (Alg) foam scaffold supplemented with chondroitin sulfate (CS) allows the attachment, survival and chondrogenesis of BM-MSCs and articular chondrocytes. The foams were prepared using a freeze-drying method; some of them were supplemented with CS and subsequently characterized for porosity, biodegradation and mechanical profile. BM-MSCs were cultured for 1-2 weeks on the scaffold either under chondrogenic or maintenance conditions. Cell vitality assays, histology, glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) assay, and type II and I collagen immunolabelings were performed to monitor cell growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in the scaffolds. Scaffolds had a high porosity ~93-95% with a mean pore sizes of 237±48 μm (Alg) and 197±61 μm (Alg/CS). Incorporation of CS increased mechanical strength of the foams providing gradually CS release over 7 days. Most of the cells survived in the scaffolds. BM-MSCs and articular chondrocytes formed rounded clusters within the scaffold pores. The BM-MSCs, irrespective of whether cultured under non/chondrogenic conditions and chondrocytes produced an ECM containing sGAGs, and types II and I collagen.

However, low isolation efficiency of synMSCs limits their therapeutic application. Niche-preserving non-enzymatic isolation of synMSCs was firstly attempted by employing micro-organ culture system based on recapitulating tissue-specific homeostasis ex vivo. The isolated synMSCs retained superior long-term growth competency, proliferation and chondrogenic potential to bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). It was noted that synMSCs demonstrated 9-fold increase in cartilaginous micro-tissue formation and 13-fold increase in sulfated proteoglycans deposition compared to BMSCs. For delivery of synMSCs, fibrous PLGA scaffolds were specifically designed for full-thickness osteochondral defects in rabbits. The scaffolds provided effective micro-environment for growth and host-integration of synMSCs. Combined delivery of synMSCs with bone morphogenetic proteins-7 (BMP-7) was designed to achieve synergistic therapeutic efficacy. BMP-7-loaded PLGA nanoparticles electrosprayed onto the scaffolds released BMP-7 over 2 weeks to conform with its aimed role in stimulating early stage endochondral ossification.

MRI analysis showed moderate to complete filling with a normal to incidentally hyperintense signal in most cases. Results did not show a clinical impact of patient's age at the time of operation, body mass index and number of previous operations (n.s.). In contrast, males showed significant higher values in the ICRS score compared to their female counterparts. AMIC is an effective and safe method of treating symptomatic full-thickness chondral defects of the knee in appropriately selected cases. However, further studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine whether the grafted area will maintain structural and functional integrity over time.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Treatment of symptomatic chondral defects is challenging due to the limited healing capacity of articular cartilage. Microfracture is the most common surgical technique used to treat chondral defects in the knee and utilizes marrow stimulation to generate a fibrocartilage repair. Microfracture has demonstrated good short-term postoperative outcomes. Long-term outcomes following microfracture are variable, with loss of improvement attributed to the poor mechanical qualities of the fibrous repair tissue. Current research is focusing on ways to optimize the repair environment after microfracture using biological scaffolds (enhanced microfracture) to facilitate chondrogenic differentiation and proliferation to improve the quality of repair tissue.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In spite of this, there has been a paucity of objective, standardised assessment of the outcome and quality of repair tissue formed. We have investigated patients treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), some in conjunction with mosaicplasty, and developed objective, semiquantitative scoring schemes to monitor the repair tissue using MRI and histology. Results indicate repair tissue to be on average 2.5 mm thick. It was of varying morphology ranging from predominantly hyaline in 22% of biopsy specimens, mixed in 48%, through to predominantly fibrocartilage, in 30%, apparently improving with increasing time postgraft. Repair tissue was well integrated with the host tissue in all aspects viewed.

Here we reported a combined technique for articular cartilage repair, consisting of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) transfected with connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) gene and NaOH-treated poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) scaffolds. In the present study, BMMSCs or CTGF-modified BMMSCs seeded on PLGA or NaOH-treated PLGA scaffolds were incubated in vitro and NaOH-treated PLGA significantly stimulated proliferation of BMMSCs, while CTGF gene transfer promoted chondrogenic differentiation. The effects of the composite on the repair of cartilage defects were evaluated in rabbit knee joints in vivo. Full-thickness cartilage defects (diameter: 5 mm; depth: 3 mm) were created unilaterally in the patellar groove. Defects were either left empty (n = 18) or implanted with BMMSCs/PLGA (n = 18), BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA (n = 18), or CTGF-modified BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA (n = 18). The defect area was examined grossly, histologically, and mechanically at 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively. Implanted cells were tracked using adeno-LacZ labeling at 6 weeks after implantation. Overall, the CTGF-modified BMMSCs/NaOH-treated PLGA group showed successful hyaline-like cartilage regeneration similar to normal cartilage, which was superior to the other groups using gross examination, qualitative and quantitative histology, and mechanical assessment. The in vivo viability of the implanted cells was demonstrated by their retention for 6 weeks after implantation. These findings suggested that a combination of CTGF-modified BMMSCs and NaOH-treated PLGA may be an alternative treatment for large osteochondral defects in high-loading sites.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Despite the limited healing potential of chondral defects, several treatment options have been proposed. However, microfracture, osteochondral autograft (or allograft) transfer, autologous chondrocyte implantation, and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation are all associated with their respective shortcomings. As such, the optimal treatment for chondral defects of the knee remains unclear. Recently, many authors have advocated treating chondral defects with biological therapies and scaffold-based treatments. Bone marrow aspirate concentrate, a cell-based injection, has gained particular attention because of its differentiation capacity and potential role in tissue regeneration. In addition, scaffold cartilage treatments have emerged and reached clinical practice. BioCartilage is one form of scaffold, which consists of extracellular matrix, and has been claimed to promote the regeneration of hyaline-like cartilage.

The rhCII hydrogels were seeded with BM-MSCs and cultured in a xeno-free chondro-inductive medium for 14, 28 and 84 days. High-density pellet cultures served as controls. The samples were subjected to biochemical, histological and gene expression analyses. Although the cells deposited glycosaminoglycans into the extracellular space significantly more slowly in the rhCII hydrogels compared to the high-density pellets, a similar potential of matrix deposition was reached by the end of the 84-day culture. At day 28 of culture, the gene expression level for cartilage marker genes (i.e. genes encoding for Sox9 transcription factor, Collagen type II and Aggrecan) were considerably lower in the rhCII hydrogels than in the high-density pellets, but at the end of the 84-day culture period, all the cartilage marker genes analysed were expressed at a similar level. Interestingly, the expression of the matrix metallopeptidases (MMP)-13, MMP-14 and MMP-8, i.e. extracellular collagen network-degrading enzymes, were transiently upregulated in the rhCII hydrogel, indicating active matrix reorganization. This study demonstrated that the rhCII hydrogel functions as a xeno-free platform for BM-MSC chondrogenesis, although the process is delayed. The reversible catabolic reaction evoked by the rhCII hydrogel might be beneficial in graft integration in vivo and pinpoints the need to further explore the use of hydrogels containing recombinant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to induce the chondrogenesis of MSCs.

The cell-scaffold construct is implanted in the debrided cartilage defect and fixed only with fibrin glue, with no periosteal cover or further surgical fixation. In a clinical pilot study, the MACI technique was used for the treatment of full-thickness, weight-bearing chondral defects of the femoral condyle in 16 patients. All patients were followed prospectively and the early postoperative attachment rate, 34.7 days (range: 22-47) after the scaffold implantation, was determined. With the use of high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the transplant was graded as completely attached, partially attached, or detached. In 14 of 16 patients (87.5%), a completely-attached graft was found, and the cartilage defect site was totally covered by the implanted scaffold and repair tissue. In one patient (6.25%), a partial attachment occurred with partial filling of the chondral defect. A complete detachment of the graft was found in one patient (6.25%), which resulted in an empty defect site with exposure of the subchondral bone. Interobserver variability for the MRI grading of the transplants showed substantial agreement (kappa=0.775) and perfect agreement (kappa(w)=0.99). In conclusion, the implantation and fixation of a cell-scaffold construct in a deep cartilage defect of the femoral condyle with fibrin glue and with no further surgical fixation leads to a high attachment rate 34.7 days after the implantation, as determined with high resolution MRI.",2005,Jeyaraman_2020,0

To overcome the disadvantages of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and to improve the outcomes of autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC), the latter technique is currently augmented with bone marrow concentrate injected under or seeded onto the scaffold. However, to date, only a little is known about histological outcomes of either the AMIC technique or AMIC associated with bone marrow concentrate. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of the repair tissue obtained from biopsies harvested during second-look arthroscopy after arthroscopic AMIC augmented with bone marrow concentrate. We analysed five second-look core biopsies harvested at 12 months follow-up. At the time of biopsy the surgeon reported the quality of the repair tissue using the standard ICRS Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA). Every biopsy together with patient data was sent to our centre to undergo blind histological evaluation (ICRS II Visual Histological Assessment Scale) and data analysis. Five asymptomatic patients (mean age 43.4 years) had isolated lesions (mean size was 3.7 cm2) at the medial femoral condyle. All the implants appeared nearly normal (ICRS CRA) at arthroscopic evaluation and had a mean overall histological (ICRS II) of 59.8±14,5. Hyaline-like matrix was found in only one case, a mixture of hyaline/fibrocartilage was found in one case and fibrocartilage was found three cases. Our clinical and histological data suggest that this procedure achieved a nearly normal arthroscopic appearance and a satisfactory repair tissue, which was possibly still maturing at 12 months follow-up.

Studies with growth factors, implantation of autologous chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells have led to variable, to some extent inconsistent, results. This work compares osteochondral knee-defect repair in rabbits upon implantation of a previously described alginate/(poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) osteochondral scaffold in distinct conditions. Systems were either in vitro pre-cultured with a small number of allogeneic chondrocytes under fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 stimulation or the same amount of allogeneic, marrow derived, mesenchymal stem cells (without any pre-differentiation), or loaded with microsphere-encapsulated bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 within the alginate layer, or holding combinations of one or the other cell type with BMP-2. The experimental limit was 12 weeks, because a foregoing study with this release system had shown a maintained tissue response for at least 24 weeks post-operation. After only 6 weeks, histological analyses revealed newly formed cartilage-like tissue, which resembled the adjacent, normal cartilage in cell as well as BMP-2 treated defects, but cell therapy gave higher histological scores. This advantage evened out until 12 weeks. Combinations of cells and BMP-2 did not result in any additive or synergistic effect. Equally efficient osteochondral defect repair was achieved with chondrocyte, stem cell, and BMP-2 treatment. Expression of collagen X and collagen I, signs of ongoing ossification, were histologically undetectable, and the presence of aggrecan protein indicated cartilage-like tissue. In conclusion, further work should demonstrate whether spatiotemporally controlled, on-site BMP-2 release alone could become a feasible therapeutic approach to repair large osteochondral defects.",2013,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Stem cells have emerged promising biologics in regenerative medicine. Previous research has widely demonstrated that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) can promote cartilage repair due to their multipotency. However, enzymatic isolation and monolayer expansion of ADSCs decrease their differentiation potential and limit their clinical application. Here, a novel adipose tissue-derived product, extracellular matrix/stromal vascular fraction gel (ECM/SVF-gel), was obtained by simple mechanical shifting and centrifugation to separate the fat oil and concentrate the effective constituents. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of this natural biomaterial on the repair of articular cartilage defects. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the fibrous structure in the ECM/SVF-gel was preserved. ADSCs sprouted from the ECM/SVF-gel were characterized by their ability of differentiation into chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and adipocytes. In a rabbit model, critical-sized cartilage defects (diameter, 4 mm; depth, 1.5 mm) were created and treated with microfracture (MF) or a combination of autologous ECM/SVF-gel injection. The knee joints were evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks through magnetic resonance imaging, macroscopic observation, histology, and immunohistochemistry. The International Cartilage Repair Society score and histological score were significantly higher in the ECM/SVF-gel group than those in the MF-treated group. The ECM/SVF-gel distinctly improved cartilage regeneration, integration with surrounding normal cartilage, and the expression of hyaline cartilage marker, type II collagen, in comparison with the MF treatment alone. Overall, the ready-to-use ECM/SVF-gel is a promising therapeutic strategy to facilitate articular cartilage regeneration. Moreover, due to the simple, time-sparing, cost-effective, enzyme-free, and minimally invasive preparation process, this gel provides a valuable alternative to stem cell-based therapy for clinical translation.",2020,Jeyaraman_2020,0

During ten autologous chondrocyte implantations in articular cartilage lesions of the knee in ten patients, small amounts of cells to be implanted were collected and analyzed by morphology, cytochemistry (alcian blue, safranin-O), and immunocytochemistry (antibodies anti-S100 protein, anti-collagen types I and II, anti-chondroitin-S). In four cases the cells were also cultured for 3 weeks. At 1, 10, and 20 days of culture cells were incubated with 1 microCi/ml [3H]thymidine for proliferation analysis. In all cases the cells showed the morphological appearance of mature chondrocytes, stained positively for alcian blue and safranin-O, and revealed a strong immunoreaction for S-100 protein, type II collagen, and chondroitin-S but not for type I collagen. Radioisotope assay of chondrocyte proliferation at 1, 10, and 20 days of culture revealed a progressive increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation.

PGA implants (+/- bovine chondrocytes) were placed inside cartilage rings punched out of bovine femoral trochleas (outer Ø 6 mm; inner defect Ø 2 mm) and cultured for 84 days (12 weeks). Cartilage/PGA hybrids were subsequently analyzed by histology (hematoxylin/eosin; safranin O), immunohistochemistry (aggrecan, collagens 1 and 2), protein assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions, and implant push-out force measurements. Cartilage/PGA hybrids remained vital with intact matrix until 12 weeks, limited loss of proteoglycans from ""host"" cartilage or cartilage-PGA interface, and progressively diminishing release of proteoglycans into the supernatant. By contrast, the collagen 2 content in cartilage and cartilage-PGA interface remained approximately constant during culture (with only little collagen 1). Both implants (+/- cells) displayed implant colonization and progressively increased aggrecan and collagen 2 mRNA, but significantly decreased push-out forces over time. Cell-loaded PGA showed significantly accelerated cell colonization and significantly extended deposition of aggrecan.

20025455,Strategies for articular cartilage lesion repair and functional restoration.,"Tamer A E Ahmed, Maxwell T Hincke","Injury of articular cartilage due to trauma or pathological conditions is the major cause of disability worldwide, especially in North America. The increasing number of patients suffering from joint-related conditions leads to a concomitant increase in the economic burden. In this review article, we focus on strategies to repair and replace knee joint cartilage, since knee-associated disabilities are more prevalent than any other joint. Because of inadequacies associated with widely used approaches, the orthopedic community has an increasing tendency to develop biological strategies, which include transplantation of autologous (i.e., mosaicplasty) or allogeneic osteochondral grafts, autologous chondrocytes (autologous chondrocyte transplantation), or tissue-engineered cartilage substitutes. Tissue-engineered cartilage constructs represent a highly promising treatment option for knee injury as they mimic the biomechanical environment of the native cartilage and have superior integration capabilities. Currently, a wide range of tissue-engineering-based strategies are established and investigated clinically as an alternative to the routinely used techniques (i.e., knee replacement and autologous chondrocyte transplantation). Tissue-engineering-based strategies include implantation of autologous chondrocytes in combination with collagen I, collagen I/III (matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation), HYAFF 11 (Hyalograft C), and fibrin glue (Tissucol) or implantation of minced cartilage in combination with copolymers of polyglycolic acid along with polycaprolactone (cartilage autograft implantation system), and fibrin glue (DeNovo NT graft). Tissue-engineered cartilage replacements show better clinical outcomes in the short term, and with advances that have been made in orthopedics they can be introduced arthroscopically in a minimally invasive fashion. Thus, the future is bright for this innovative approach to restore function.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In the repair process, although underlying subchondral bone becomes necrotic and then is followed by bone reconstruction, the fate of graft and host cells during remodeling of underlying subchondral bone has not been elucidated. The objectives of this study were to establish a method to follow graft and host cells after transplantation of osteochondral autograft, and to elucidate the fate of both graft and host cells during remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. For these purposes, autologous transplantation models employing transgenic rats and wild-type rats, which were genetically identical to each other except for transgenes, were used. Two transplantation models were designed so that either the graft or the host cells had transgenes. Model I: transgenic rats were the donor, and wild-type rats were the recipient; model II: conversely, wild-type rats were the donor, and transgenic rats were the recipient. The grafted bone marrow cells and osteocytes in the trabeculae survived in the graft at 3 weeks after transplantation. Invasion of the host bone marrow cells into the graft was also found. Thus, bone marrow cells in the host as well as both bone marrow cells and osteocytes in the graft could potentially participate in the remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. Furthermore, the interface between graft and host was consisted with both graft and host derived cells. Since new bone formation was found in this space, both graft and host cells could have the potential to contribute to remodeling of underlying subchondral bone. The two models of the transplantations using the transgenic rats were found to be beneficial in following graft cells as well as host cells and in understanding their function on healing after autologous transplantation.",2002,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Six and twelve months after MACI, patients IKDC-score was analysed, as well as the results of MRI-examinations. Specimens of the scaffold were histologically assessed at the time of implantation. The IKDC-score as well as the MRI-score improved significantly during follow up. The number of morphological abnormal cells was correlated with a poor clinical outcome. Defect aetiology proved to be a decisive factor for good clinical outcome. Patients with a short history of trauma (<1 year) and an osteochondritis dissecans were found to have better scores 1 year after MACI than patients with a trauma more than 1 year ago. Defect-size, patients age and -gender did not significantly influence the clinical outcome. No differences were seen when MACI was used as first- or second-line procedure.

Injectable scaffolds have the versatility to be used in large and irregularly shaped lesions. With correct preparation, they can be applied to lesions on the femoral condyle that may be vertical, or even inverted lesions such as those in the patella. They can be combined with bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) to provide mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), thereby avoiding the need for microfracture.

The purpose of this study was to find a simple, effective 1-step articular cartilage repair method. Because stem cell niches produce a microenvironment for stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation, we integrated in situ bone marrow stem cells with an implanted poly(L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLLGA) scaffold. Marrow stem cells grew and proliferated on cell-free PLLGA scaffolds, which were evaluated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Twenty-seven rabbits (54 knees) with large cylinder femoral trochlear cartilage defects were created and repaired with microfracture and cell-free PLLGA scaffold implantation (group 1), microfracture (group 2), or cell-free PLLGA scaffold implantation (group 3).Outcomes were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging, International Cartilage Repair Society scores, histology, and immunohistochemistry. The repair effects were better in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3. In group 1, hyaline-like cartilage formed at week 24. Magnetic resonance imaging showed homogeneous signals as the adjacent normal cartilage. Collagen type II and toluidine blue were stained positively as normal cartilage tissue, and the color and thickness of regenerated tissue were similar to surrounding normal tissue.

26858950,Chondrogenesis of Human Infrapatellar Fat Pad Stem Cells on Acellular Dermal Matrix.,"Ken Ye, Kathy Traianedes, Peter F M Choong, Damian E Myers","Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) has been in clinical use for decades in numerous surgical applications. The ability for ADM to promote cellular repopulation, revascularisation and tissue regeneration is well documented. Adipose stem cells have the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissue types, including bone and cartilage. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential interaction between ADM and adipose stem cells in vitro using TGFβ3 and BMP6. Human infrapatellar fat pad-derived adipose stem cells (IPFP-ASC) were cultured with ADM derived from rat dermis in chondrogenic (TGFβ3 and BMP6) medium in vitro for 2 and 4 weeks. Histology, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess for markers of chondrogenesis (collagen Type II, SOX9 and proteoglycans). At 4 weeks, cell-scaffold constructs displayed cellular changes consistent with chondrogenesis, with evidence of stratification of cell layers and development of a hyaline-like cartilage layer superficially, which stained positively for collagen Type II and proteoglycans. Significant cell-matrix interaction was seen between the cartilage layer and the ADM itself with seamless integration between each layer. Real time qPCR showed significantly increased COL2A1, SOX9, and ACAN gene expression over 4 weeks when compared to control. COL1A2 gene expression remained unchanged over 4 weeks. We believe that the principles that make ADM versatile and successful for tissue regeneration are applicable to cartilage regeneration. This study demonstrates in vitro the ability for IPFP-ASCs to undergo chondrogenesis, infiltrate, and interact with ADM. These outcomes serve as a platform for in vivo modelling of ADM for cartilage repair.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical and MRI outcome after the implantation of a nanostructured biomimetic three-phasic collagen-hydroxyapatite construct for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral defects of the knee in a large cohort of patients. Seventy-nine patients (63 M, 16 W), affected by grade III-IV femoral condyle or trochlea chondral lesions or osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) were consecutively treated. Mean age was 31.0 ± 11.3 years, mean lesion size was 3.2 ± 2.0 cm(2). Fifty patients underwent previous surgeries, concurrent procedures were necessary in 39 cases. The clinical outcome was evaluated using the IKDC and Tegner scores at 12 and 24 months of follow-up. At follow-up times an MRI was performed and evaluated with the MOCART score. All the scores improved significantly from the baseline. IKDC subjective score showed a further increase between 12 and 24 months of follow-up, and 82.2% of the patients improved their symptoms at the final evaluation. Patients affected by OCDs had better results than those with degenerative lesions. Some abnormal MRI findings were present, even though no correlation was found with the clinical outcome.

Current clinical focal defect repair strategies have had limited success. New scaffold-based approaches may provide solutions that can repair extensive damage and prevent osteoarthritis. This study utilized a novel scaffold design that accommodated strain gauges for shear and axial load monitoring in the canine stifle joint through implantable telemetry technology. Loading changes induced by ligament disruption are widely implicated in the development of injury-related osteoarthritis. Seeding the scaffold end with progenitor cells resulted in higher shear stress than without cell seeding and histology showed significantly more bone and cartilage formation. Biomechanically, the effect of transecting the anterior cruciate ligament was a significant reduction in braking load in shear, but no change axially, and conversely a significant reduction in push-off load axially, but no change in shear. This is the first study to report shear loads measured directly in knee joint tissue.

Allogeneic (same species, different individual) or xenogeneic (different species) sources can provide an attractive source of chondrocytes for cartilage tissue engineering, since autologous (same individual) cells are scarce. Immune rejection of non-autologous hyaline articular cartilage has seldom been considered due to the popular notion of ""cartilage immunoprivilege"". The objective of this study was to determine the suitability of allogeneic and xenogeneic engineered neocartilage tissue for cartilage repair. To address this, scaffold-free tissue engineered articular cartilage of syngeneic (same genetic background), allogeneic, and xenogeneic origin were implanted into two different locations of the rabbit knee (n=3 per group/location). Xenogeneic engineered cartilage and control xenogeneic chondral explants provoked profound innate inflammatory and adaptive cellular responses, regardless of transplant location. Cytological quantification of immune cells showed that, while allogeneic neocartilage elicited an immune response in the patella, negligible responses were observed when implanted into the trochlea; instead the responses were comparable to microfracture-treated empty defect controls. Allogeneic neocartilage survived within the trochlea implant site and demonstrated graft integration into the underlying bone. In conclusion, the knee joint cartilage does not represent an immune privileged site, strongly rejecting xenogeneic but not allogeneic chondrocytes in a location-dependent fashion. This difference in location-dependent survival of allogeneic tissue may be associated with proximity to the synovium.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Since bone marrow contains osteochondral progenitor cells and bioactive agents, it is hypothesized that the combination of scaffold and bone marrow would be a superior composite material for osteochondral repair. This hypothesis will be tested by comparing the outcome of osteochondral defects filled with a fibronectin-coated hyaluronan-based sponge (ACP) with or without autologous bone marrow. Thirty-three 4-month-old rabbits received 3-mm diameter osteochondral defects that were then filled with ACP loaded or not with autologous bone marrow. Rabbits were sacrificed at 2, 3, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery and the condyles processed for histologic and immunohistochemical evaluation. The defects were graded with a histologic scoring scale. Except for the 3-week specimens, the histologic appearance of the defects was similar in both groups. Four weeks after surgery, the defects were filled with bone with a top layer of cartilage well integrated with the adjacent cartilage. Twelve and 24 weeks after surgery, the defects again showed bone filling. The primary difference between the 4-week samples and the 12- and 24-week samples was that the layer of cartilage that appeared to be thinner than the adjacent cartilage. At each harvest time, the overall histologic scores of the specimens did not reveal statistical differences between the treatment groups. However, as revealed by the results of the 3-week sacrifices, bone marrow loading appeared to accelerate the first stages of the repair process. The fibronectin-coated hyaluronan-based scaffold appears to organize the natural response and facilitate the integration of the neo-cartilage with the adjacent tissue. The fundamental tissue engineering principles derived from this study should provide guidelines for the development of comparable clinical reconstructive therapies.",2002,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Recently established procedures like autologous chondrocyte implantation or matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation yield good results, but include the disadvantage of two-step procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcome of repairs of osteochondral defects of the knee by a combined procedure of bone grafting and covering with a bilayer collagen membrane in a sandwich technique. Seven male patients with a mean age of 42 (range 30-55) years and symptomatic focal osteochondral lesions of the knee grade IV according to the International Cartilage Repair Society classification were included. The mean diameter of defects was 28.6 (range 15-40) mm. Results were evaluated at a minimum of 24 months after surgery by International Knee Documentation Committee score, Lysholm-score, visual analogue scale, and magnetic resonance imaging with specific cartilage sequences, evaluating the ICRS score and the Magnetic Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score. All patients judged the operation as successful. Among the patients available for the long-term follow-up, mean visual analogue scale value was 1.3 (range 0-3) out of 10 points. Mean International Knee Documentation Committee score was 80.8 (range 63.2-88.5) out of 100 points. Mean Lysholm score was 85 (range 55-95) out of 100 points.

Five study groups were defined: (a) gellan gum with encapsulated chondrogenic predifferentiated rabbit adipose stem cells (ASC + GF); (b) gellan gum with encapsulated nonchondrogenic predifferentiated rabbit adipose stem cells (ASC); (c) gellan gum with encapsulated rabbit articular chondrocytes (AC) (standard control); (d) gellan gum alone (control); (e) empty defect (control). Full-thickness articular cartilage defects were created and the gellan gum constructs were injected and left for 8 weeks. The macroscopic aspect of the explants showed a progressive increase of similarity with the lateral native cartilage, stable integration at the defect site, more pronouncedly in the cell-loaded constructs. Tissue scoring showed that ASC + GF exhibited the best results regarding tissue quality progression. Alcian blue retrieved similar results with a better outcome for the cell-loaded constructs. Regarding real-time PCR analyses, ASC + GF had the best progression with an upregulation of collagen type II and aggrecan, and a downregulation of collagen type I. Gellan gum hydrogels combined with autologous cells constitute a promising approach for the treatment of articular cartilage defects, and adipose derived cells may constitute a valid alternative to currently used articular chondrocytes.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0

We previously developed a mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based treatment approach for haemophilic arthropathy in a mouse model of haemophilia A. Here, we evaluated the long-term safety of intra-articular injection of lentivirally transduced autologous MSCs in non-human primates. Autologous bone-marrow-derived MSCs transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) were injected into the left knee joint of cynomolgus monkeys. We first conducted codon optimization to increase FVIII production in the cells. Lentiviral transduction of autologous MSCs resulted in a significant increase of FVIII in the culture supernatant before transplantation. We did not find any tumour generation around the knee structure at 11-16 months after injection by magnetic resonance imaging. The proviral sequence of the simian immunodeficiency virus lentiviral vector was not detected in the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, testis, or bone marrow by real-time quantitative PCR.

There is a growing interest in the use of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for OA treatment and developing biomimetic injectable hydrogels as cell delivery systems. Biomimetic injectable hydrogels can simulate the native tissue microenvironment by providing appropriate biological and chemical cues for tissue regeneration. A biomimetic injectable hydrogel using amnion membrane (AM) was developed which can self-assemble in situ and retain the stem cells at the target site. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of intraarticular injections of AM hydrogels with and without ADSCs in reducing inflammation and cartilage degeneration in a collagenase-induced OA rat model. A week after the induction of OA, rats were treated with control (phosphate-buffered saline), ADSCs, AM gel, and AM-ADSCs. Inflammation and cartilage regeneration was evaluated by joint swelling, analysis of serum by cytokine profiling and Raman spectroscopy, gross appearance, and histology. Both AM and ADSC possess antiinflammatory and chondroprotective properties to target the sites of inflammation in an osteoarthritic joint, thereby reducing the inflammation-mediated damage to the articular cartilage. The present study demonstrated the potential of AM hydrogel to foster cartilage tissue regeneration, a comparable regenerative effect of AM hydrogel and ADSCs, and the synergistic antiinflammatory and chondroprotective effects of AM and ADSC to regenerate cartilage tissue in a rat OA model.",2022,Jeyaraman_2020,0
23700485,A novel biological approach to treat chondromalacia patellae.,"Jaewoo Pak, Jung Hun Lee, Sang Hee Lee","Mesenchymal stem cells from several sources (bone marrow, synovial tissue, cord blood, and adipose tissue) can differentiate into variable parts (bones, cartilage, muscle, and adipose tissue), representing a promising new therapy in regenerative medicine. In animal models, mesenchymal stem cells have been used successfully to regenerate cartilage and bones. However, there have been no follow-up studies on humans treated with adipose-tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) for the chondromalacia patellae. To obtain ADSCs, lipoaspirates were obtained from lower abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. The stromal vascular fraction was separated from the lipoaspirates by centrifugation after treatment with collagenase. The stem-cell-containing stromal vascular fraction was mixed with calcium chloride-activated platelet rich plasma and hyaluronic acid, and this ADSCs mixture was then injected under ultrasonic guidance into the retro-patellar joints of all three patients. Patients were subjected to pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Pre- and post-treatment subjective pain scores and physical therapy assessments measured clinical changes. One month after the injection of autologous ADSCs, each patient's pain improved 50-70%. Three months after the treatment, the patients' pain improved 80-90%. The pain improvement persisted over 1 year, confirmed by telephone follow ups. Also, all three patients did not report any serious side effects. The repeated magnetic resonance imaging scans at three months showed improvement of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages) on the patellae-femoral joints. In patients with chondromalacia patellae who have continuous anterior knee pain, percutaneous injection of autologous ADSCs may play an important role in the restoration of the damaged tissues (softened cartilages). Thus, ADSCs treatment presents a glimpse of a new promising, effective, safe, and non-surgical method of treatment for chondromalacia patellae.",2013,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Gelatin microspheres loaded with TGF-beta1 (MS-TGFbeta1) showed a fast release at the initial phase (37.4%), and the ultimate accumulated release was 83.1% by day 18. The autologous MSCs seeded on MS-TGFbeta1/scaffold were implanted to repair full-thickness cartilage defects in rabbits as in vivo differentiation repair group, while MSCs differentiated in vitro were seeded on scaffold without MS-TGFbeta1 to repair the contra lateral cartilage defects (n = 30). Fifteen additional rabbits without treatment for defects were used as control. Histology observation showed that the in vivo differentiation repair group had better chondrocyte morphology, integration, continuous subchondral bone, and much thicker newly formed cartilage layer when compared to in vitro differentiation repair group 12 and 24 weeks, postoperatively. There was a significant difference in histological grading score between these two experimental groups, and both showed much better repair than that of the control.

Chondral defects may arise from a variety of joint pathologies and left untreated, will likely progress to osteoarthritis. Current repair techniques, such as microfracture, result in short-term clinical improvements but have poor long-term outcomes. Emerging scaffold-based repair strategies have reported superior outcomes compared to microfracture and motivate the development of new biomaterials for this purpose. In this study, unique composite implants consisting of a base porous reinforcing component (woven poly(ε-caprolactone)) infiltrated with 1 of 2 hydrogels (self-assembling peptide or thermo-gelling hyaluronan) or bone marrow aspirate were evaluated. The objective was to evaluate cartilage repair with composite scaffold treatment compared to the current standard of care (microfracture) in a translationally relevant large animal model, the Yucatan minipig. While many cartilage-repair studies have shown some success in vivo, most are short term and not clinically relevant. Informed by promising 6-week findings, a 12-month study was carried out and those results are presented here. To aid in comparisons across platforms, several structural and functionally relevant outcome measures were performed. Despite positive early findings, the long-term results indicated less than optimal structural and mechanical results with respect to cartilage repair, with all treatment groups performing worse than the standard of care.

Numerous biomechanical, histological, animal and clinical studies have evaluated the different technical aspects of this procedure. The preoperative work-up encompasses an evaluation of functional disturbances, alignment, knee stability and imaging (CT arthrography or MRI with cartilage sequences). The surgical procedure includes harvesting the grafts by mini-arthrotomy of the medial or lateral trochlea and a stage for arthroscopic graft insertion. The ICRS classification is used to describe the defect (area, depth, location) before and then after debridement. A few, large diameter grafts are harvested from the trochlea across from the defect. The graft plugs are transplanted by press-fit, flush with the cartilage, along a convergent plane in recipient sockets of exactly the same depth. Each stage, harvesting, drilling and insertion is repeated until all the full-thickness gap region has been covered. Postoperative movement is free but weight-bearing is delayed for 2 to 4 weeks. Mosaicplasty is indicated in young patients (under 50), with symptomatic chondral or osteochondral defects of less than 3 cm in the weight-bearing part of the femoral condyle. Pre-osteoarthritis is an absolute contraindictation for this procedure. Any misalignment (of more than 5°) or sagittal instability is treated simultaneously.

To overcome this limitation, an expandable scaffold with a honeycomb-like structure has been developed using microfluidic technology. In this study, we evaluated the performance of this expandable gelatin scaffold seeded with rabbit chondrocytes in vivo. The chondrocyte/scaffold constructs were implanted into regions of surgically introduced cylindrical osteochondral defects in rabbit femoral condyles. At 2, 4, and 6 months postsurgery, the implanted constructs were evaluated by gross and histological examinations. As expected, the osteochondral defects, which were untreated or transplanted with blank scaffolds, showed no signs of repair, whereas the defects transplanted with chondrocyte/scaffold constructs showed significant cartilage regeneration. Furthermore, the expandable scaffolds seeded with chondrocytes had more regenerated cartilage tissue and better integration with the recipient tissue than autologous chondrocyte implantation. Biomechanical tests revealed that the chondrocyte/scaffold group had the highest compressive strength among all groups at all three time points and endured a similar compressive force to normal cartilage after 6 months of implantation. Histological examinations revealed that the chondrocytes were distributed uniformly within the scaffolds, maintained a normal phenotype, and secreted functional components of the extracellular matrix. Histomorphometric assessment showed a remarkable total interface of up to 87% integration of the expandable scaffolds with the host tissue at 6 months postoperation.

As a bioactive adjunct to the biomaterial, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) has been shown to be essential for cell differentiation into a chondrocyte phenotype and maintenance thereof, but the low amounts of endogenous TGF-β in the in vivo joint microenvironment necessitate a mechanism for controlled delivery and release of this growth factor. In this study, TGF-β3 was directly loaded with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into poly-d,l-lactic acid/polyethylene glycol/poly-d,l-lactic acid (PDLLA-PEG) hydrogel, or PDLLA-PEG with the addition of hyaluronic acid (PDLLA/HA), and cultured in vitro. We hypothesize that the inclusion of HA within PDLLA-PEG would result in a controlled release of the loaded TGF-β3 and lead to a robust cartilage formation without the use of TGF-β3 in the culture medium. ELISA analysis showed that TGF-β3 release was effectively slowed by HA incorporation, and retention of TGF-β3 in the PDLLA/HA scaffold was detected by immunohistochemistry for up to 3 weeks. By means of both in vitro culture and in vivo implantation, we found that sulfated glycosaminoglycan production was higher in PDLLA/HA groups with homogenous distribution throughout the scaffold than PDLLA groups. Finally, with an optimal loading of TGF-β3 at 10 μg/mL, as determined by RT-PCR and glycosaminoglycan production, an almost twofold increase in Young's modulus of the construct was seen over a 4-week period compared to TGF-β3 delivery in the culture medium. Taken together, our results indicate that the direct loading of TGF-β3 and stem cells in PDLLA/HA has the potential to be a one-step point-of-care treatment for cartilage injury. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Stem cell-seeded hydrogels are commonly used in cell-based cartilage tissue engineering, but they generally fail to possess physiologically relevant mechanical properties suitable for loading. Moreover, degradation of the hydrogel in vivo with time further decreases mechanical suitability of the hydrogel due in part to the lack of TGF-β3 signaling. In this study, we demonstrated that incorporation of hyaluronic acid (HA) into a physiologically stiff PDLLA-PEG hydrogel allowed for slow release of one-time preloaded TGF-β3, and when loaded with adult mesenchymal stem cells and cultured in vitro, it resulted in higher chondrogenic gene expression and constructs of significantly higher mechanical strength than constructs cultured in conventional TGF-β3-supplemented medium. Similar effects were also observed in constructs implanted in vivo. Our results indicate that direct loading of TGF-β3 combined with HA in the physiologically stiff PDLLA-PEG hydrogel has the potential to be used for one-step point-of-care treatment of cartilage injury.",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0

30300711,Cartilaginous extracellular matrix derived from decellularized chondrocyte sheets for the reconstruction of osteochondral defects in rabbits.,"Zhifa Wang, Zhiye Li, Zhijin Li, Buling Wu, Yanpu Liu, Wei Wu","Cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) materials derived from decellularized native articular cartilage are widely used in cartilage regeneration. However, it is difficult for endogenous cells to migrate into ECM derived from native cartilage owing to its nonporous structure and dense nature. Moreover, current decellularization approaches frequently lead to architectural breakdown and potential loss of surface composition of ECM. To solve this problem, we aimed to establish a novel biological ECM scaffold from chondrocyte sheets for cartilage regeneration. We cultured chondrocytes harvested from the auricular cartilage of 4-week-old New Zealand rabbits and enabled them to form cell sheets. These sheets were decellularized using sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with three different concentrations, namely, 1%, 5%, and 10%, followed by 1% Triton X-100 and deoxyribonuclease enzyme solution. In vitro microstructural examination and mechanical tests demonstrated that 1% SDS not only removed chondrocytes completely but also maintained the native architecture and composition of ECM, thus avoiding the use of high-concentration SDS. Application of decellularized chondrocyte sheets for osteochondral defects in rabbits resulted in substantial host remodeling and variant regeneration of osteochondral tissues. One percent SDS-treated decellularized chondrocyte sheets contributed to the superior reconstruction of osteochondral defects as compared with 5% and 10% SDS groups, which includes vascularized subchondral bone, articular cartilage with adequate thickness, and integration with host tissues. Furthermore, ECM from 1% SDS significantly increased the migrating potential of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in vitro. RT-PCR and western blot also revealed that ECM increased the expression of SOX-9 in BMSCs, whereas it decreased COL-X expression. In conclusion, our results suggested that the chondrocyte sheets decellularized with 1% SDS preserved the integrity and bioactivity, which favored cell recruitment and enabled osteochondral regeneration in the knee joints of rabbits, thus offering a promising approach for articular cartilage reconstruction without cell transplantation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although biological extracellular matrix (ECM) derived from decellularized native cartilage has been widely used in cartilage regeneration, it is difficult for endogenous cells to migrate into ECM owing to its dense nature. Moreover, current decellularization approaches lead to architectural breakdown of ECM. This study established a novel biological ECM from decellularized chondrocyte sheets for cartilage regeneration.

Advanced biomaterials and tissue engineered constructs have been developed to improve cartilage repair; nevertheless, their clinical translation has been hampered by the lack of reliable in vitro models suitable for pre-clinical screening of new implants and compounds. In this study, an osteochondral defect model in a bioreactor that mimics the multi-axial motion of an articulating joint, was developed. Osteochondral explants were obtained from bovine stifle joints, and cartilage defects of 4 mm diameter were created. The explants were used as an interface against a ceramic ball applying dynamic compressive and shear loading. Osteochondral defects were filled with chondrocytes-seeded fibrin-polyurethane constructs and subjected to mechanical stimulation. Cartilage viability, proteoglycan accumulation and gene expression of seeded chondrocytes were compared to free swelling controls. Cells within both cartilage and bone remained viable throughout the 10-day culture period. Loading did not wear the cartilage, as indicated by histological evaluation and glycosaminoglycan release. The gene expression of seeded chondrocytes indicated a chondrogenic response to the mechanical stimulation. Proteoglycan 4 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein were markedly increased, while mRNA ratios of collagen type II to type I and aggrecan to versican were also enhanced. This mechanically stimulated osteochondral defect culture model provides a viable microenvironment and will be a useful pre-clinical tool to screen new biomaterials and biological regenerative therapies under relevant complex mechanical stimuli. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Articular cartilage lesions have a poor healing capacity and reflect one of the most challenging problems in orthopedic clinical practice. The aim of current research is to develop a testing system to assess biomaterials for implants, that can permanently replace damaged cartilage with the original hyaline structure and can withstand the mechanical forces long term.

HA has been incorporated in a number of biomaterial and scaffold systems. However, HA in the material may be difficult to control if it is not chemically modified and chemical modification of HA may negatively impact biological function. In this study, we developed a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel with noncovalent HA-binding capabilities and evaluated its ability to support cartilage formation in vitro and in an articular defect model. Chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in the HA-interactive scaffolds containing various amounts of exogenous HA was evaluated. The HA-binding hydrogel without exogenous HA produced the best cartilage as determined by biochemical content (glysocaminoglycan and collagen), histology (Safranin O and type II collagen staining), and gene expression analysis for aggrecan, type I collagen, type II collagen, and sox-9. This HA-binding formulation was then translated to an osteochondral defect model in the rat knee. After 6 weeks, histological analysis demonstrated improved cartilage tissue production in defects treated with the HA-interactive hydrogel compared to noninteractive control scaffolds and untreated defects. In addition to the tissue repair in the defect space, the Safranin O staining in cartilage tissue surrounding the defect was greater in treatment groups where the HA-binding scaffold was applied. In sum, incorporation of a noncovalent HA-binding functionality into biomaterials provides an ability to interact with local or exogenous HA, which can then impact tissue remodeling and ultimately new tissue production.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

However, achieving reconstitution of actual physiologically relevant, appropriately-laminated cartilage in situ that would be applicable to conditions, such as arthritis and cartilage degeneration remains elusive.

We report an efficient approach for deriving mesenchymal chondroprogenitor cells from human embryonic stem cells. These cells generated tissue containing cartilage-specific matrix proteins that integrated in situ in a partial-thickness defect in ex vivo articular cartilage harvested from human arthritic joints.

To repair complexly shaped cartilage tissue defects, we propose the application of microtissues fabricated from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) cultured in natural bionic nanofibrous microcarriers (NF-MCs). The NF-MCs were structurally and functionally designed to mimic natural extracellular matrix (ECM) by crosslinking dialdehyde bacterial cellulose (DBC) with DL-allo-hydroxylysine (DHYL) and complexing chitosan (CS) with DHYL through electrostatic interactions. The orthogonal design allows for fine tuning of fiber diameter, pore size, porosity, mechanical properties, and biodegradation rate of the NF-MC. BMSCs cultured in NF-MCs showed improved proliferation compared with those cultured in chitosan microcarriers (CS-MCs). After three-week culture under microgravity conditions, functional cartilage microtissues were generated. When implanted into a knee articular cartilage defect in mice, the microtissue showed superior in vivo cartilage repair as characterized by cell tracking, histology, micro CT image, and gait analysis. Versatile in natural biopolymer design and biomimetic in nanofibrous component embedded in macroporous microcarriers, these injectable NC-MCs demonstrate to be effective carriers for cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, the functional microtissues also show their prospect in repair of cartilage tissue, and suggest their potential for other tissues in general.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

In vitro experiments have shown that the application of synthetic scaffolds is a promising alternative to existing therapeutic options. A sheep study was conducted to test the suitability of microporous pure β-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) ceramics as tissue engineering scaffolds for the repair of osteochondral defects. Cylindrical plugs of microporous β-TCP (diameter: 7mm; length: 25mm; porosity: 43.5±2.4%; pore diameter: ~5μm) with interconnecting pores were used. Scaffolds were seeded with autologous chondrocytes in vitro and cultured for 4weeks. A drill hole (diameter 7mm) was placed in both medial femoral condyles of sheep. For the left knee the defect was filled with a TCP plug and for the right knee the defect was left empty. After 6, 12, 26 and 52weeks, seven animals from each group were killed and studied. The samples were examined employing histological, histomorphometric and immunohistological methods as well as various imaging techniques (X-ray, microcomputer tomography and scanning electron microscopy). After explantation the cartilage defects were first assessed macroscopically. There were no signs of infection or inflammation. Histological grading scales were used for assessment of bony integration and cartilage repair. An increasing degradation (81% after 52weeks) of the ceramic with concomitant bone formation was observed. The original structure of cancellous bone was almost completely restored. After 26 and 52weeks, collagen II-positive hyaline cartilage was detected in several samples. New subchondral bone had formed. The formation of cartilage began at the outer edge and proceeded to the middle. According to the O'Driscoll score, values corresponding to healthy cartilage were not reached after 1year. Integration of the newly formed cartilage tissue into the surrounding native cartilage was found. The formation of biomechanical stable cartilage began at the edge and progressed towards the centre of the defect. After 1year this process was still not completed.

Retro-articular and trans-articular drilling of OCD lesions has up to a 33 % failure rate based on complete radiographic healing. Healing may be improved with the delivery of pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells into the lesion. We describe a technically simple procedure for retro-articular drilling with the addition of percutaneous iliac crest bone graft placement for stable juvenile OCD lesions of the knee. By using a bone marrow biopsy needle, the bone grafting can be performed in a reproducible manner and in shorter time than in previously described techniques.

It has been proposed that failure of subchondral bone maintenance or restoration is a factor contributing to the failure of cartilage-forming transplants. Some studies reveal that the transplant is associated with subchondral bone resorption, often leading to deep pits beneath the presumptive cartilage repair site. Thus, the question is raised as to the utility of agents, such as bisphosphonates, to inhibit bone remodeling at the transplant site. In the present study we show that oral administration (three times weekly) of the bisphosphonate, risedronate, inhibited the subchondral bone loss deep to the cultured allogeneic graft tissue site in attempted repair of surgically created chondral defects in a minipig model. In addition, the graft tissue, characterized by type II collagen, was retained in the majority of treated animals. Untreated minipigs displayed a deep bone resorption pit, beneath the graft region, filled with type I collagen tissue as determined through immunohistochemical staining. This fibrous tissue appeared well integrated with the host tissue in the majority of cases. In the transplanted cartilage region, the overall histological score for tissue quality was significantly (p < 0.05) better for the treated animals which displayed better matrix staining, cell clustering, tidemark integrity, and subchondral bone integrity (p < 0.05 in each category). However, the integration of allograft with host tissue did not always occur completely.

A more effective procedure that can produce hyaline-like cartilage is needed for articular cartilage repair. Mosaic osteochondral grafts for large osteochondral defects often show poor integration between the grafts and the surrounding normal cartilage, leading to defective cracks filled with fibrous tissue instead of hyaline-like cartilage.

Specifically, restoration of the osteochondral junction and secure integration with adjacent cartilage could be considered key factors. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the feasibility of a combined material comprising a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct (TEC) derived from synovial mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and a hydroxyapatite (HA) artificial bone using a rabbit osteochondral defect model. Osteochondral defects were created on the femoral groove of skeletally mature rabbits. The TEC and HA artificial bone were hybridized to develop a combined implant just before use, which was then implanted into defects (N=23). In the control group, HA alone was implanted (N=18). Histological evaluation and micro-indentation testing was performed for the evaluation of repair tissue. Normal knees were used as an additional control group for biomechanical testing (N=5). At hybridization, the TEC rapidly attached onto the surface of HA artificial bone block, which was implantable to osteochondral defects. Osteochondral defects treated with the combined implants exhibited more rapid subchondral bone repair coupled with the development of cartilaginous tissue with good tissue integration to the adjacent host cartilage when assessed at 6 months post implantation. Conversely, the control group exhibited delayed subchondral bone repair. In addition, the repair cartilaginous tissue in this group had poor integration to adjacent cartilage and contained clustered chondrocytes, suggesting an early osteoarthritis (OA)-like degenerative change at 6 months post implantation. Biomechanically, the osteochondral repair tissue treated with the combined implants at 6 months restored tissue stiffness, similar to normal osteochondral tissue. The combined implants significantly accelerated and improved osteochondral repair. Specifically, earlier restoration of subchondral bone, as well as good tissue integration of repair cartilage to adjacent host tissue could be clinically relevant in terms of the acceleration of postoperative rehabilitation and longer-term durability of repaired articular surface in patients with osteochondral lesions, including those with OA. In addition, the combined implant could be considered a promising MSC-based bio-implant with regard to safety and cost-effectiveness, considering that the TEC is a scaffold-free implant and HA artificial bone has been widely used in clinical practice.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The inability of cartilage tissue to self-repair is instrumental in developing tissue engineered substitutes. To this effect, the present study aims to engineer cartilage construct by culturing umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on novel 3D porous scaffolds developed from natural biopolymers, silk fibroin (SF) and chitosan (CS), with addition of cartilage matrix components, glucosamine (Gl) and chondroitin sulfate (Ch). The presence of Gl and Ch is expected to enhance cartilage regeneration. The developed SF/CS-Gl-Ch scaffolds possess desired pore size in the range 56.55-168.15 μm, 88-92% porosity, 44.7-46.8̊ contact angle, controlled swelling and biodegradability. Upon culturing under dynamic condition in a spinner flask bioreactor, the scaffold supported hMSCs attachment, proliferation, and further promoted chondrogenic differentiation. Cartilage-specific matrix and gene (Collagen II, Sox9 and aggrecan) expression analyses by histology, immunophenotype, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR studies showed superiority of cell-scaffold construct generated in dynamic culture towards cartilage tissue generation as compared to cell aggregates formed by pellet culture. This study demonstrates the potentiality of SF/CS-Gl-Ch porous scaffold for the development of tissue construct for cartilage regeneration under dynamic culture condition.",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Electronic databases from January 1966 to December 2006 were systematically screened. The proportion of the patient population treated successfully was noted, and percentages were calculated. For each treatment strategy, study size weighted success rates were calculated. Fifty-two studies described the results of 65 treatment groups of treatment strategies for OCD of the talus. One randomized clinical trial was identified. Seven studies described the results of non-operative treatment, 4 of excision, 13 of excision and curettage, 18 of excision, curettage and bone marrow stimulation (BMS), 4 of an autogenous bone graft, 2 of transmalleolar drilling (TMD), 9 of osteochondral transplantation (OATS), 4 of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), 3 of retrograde drilling and 1 of fixation. OATS, BMS and ACI scored success rates of 87, 85 and 76%, respectively. Retrograde drilling and fixation scored 88 and 89%, respectively. Together with the newer techniques OATS and ACI, BMS was identified as an effective treatment strategy for OCD of the talus. Because of the relatively high cost of ACI and the knee morbidity seen in OATS, we conclude that BMS is the treatment of choice for primary osteochondral talar lesions. However, due to great diversity in the articles and variability in treatment results, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Further sufficiently powered, randomized clinical trials with uniform methodology and validated outcome measures should be initiated to compare the outcome of surgical strategies for OCD of the talus.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Integrated rosette strain gauges were calibrated and used to determine shear loading within stifle joints for up to 12 months. An activity index that compared extent of daily activity with tissue formation showed differences in the extent and quality of new tissue with the most active animal having the most new tissue formation. Shear loads were highest early and decreased with time indicating that cartilage tissue formation begins while tissues experience high shear loads and continues as the loads decrease toward normal physiological levels. Scaffolds with biomimetic support pegs facilitated the most rapid bone ingrowth and were noted to have more cartilage formation with better quality cartilage as measured using both indentation testing and histology. Comparison of implant placement depth to previous studies suggested that placement depth affects the amount of tissue formation. This study provides measurements of loading patterns and cartilage regeneration on a complete medial condylar surface replacement that can be used for preclinical testing of a tissue engineering approach for the most common form of early stage osteoarthritis, unicondylar disease. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

19182038,Current and novel approaches to treating chondral lesions.,"Timothy M Wright, Suzanne A Maher","Total joint arthroplasty remains the most effective treatment to relieve pain and restore function in damaged and diseased joints; however, less invasive, more functional solutions are necessary for young, active patients who have chondral defects and are at the early stages of disease. Unfortunately, attempts at providing such a method have provided variable and often unsatisfactory outcomes. Unicondylar knee replacement, for example, is associated with a markedly higher rate of revision when compared with total knee arthroplasty, and there is a distinct probability of disease progression in the remaining joint compartments. Small metallic caps intended for filling the cartilage defects are commercially available, but the clinical follow-up of patients who have undergone this treatment is short. Although not yet in clinical use, synthetic polymeric implant scaffolds, with and without cell-seeding, are also under development. The biomechanical requirements for treating chondral lesions, like those of total knee arthroplasty, are wear and fixation. A lesion-filling implant must carry large joint loads without damaging the opposing tissue. Integration with surrounding cartilage and subchondral bone would enhance load-sharing and load transfer. The challenge of meeting these requirements is difficult, but new forms of computational models and in vitro tests can aid in establishing performance and in rapidly screening possible solutions.",2009,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Thus, the empty spaces should be repaired, and how to fill the empty spaces is still a problem. In the present study, a standardized full-thickness defect (diameter, 6 mm) was created in the weight-bearing area of each medial femoral condyle in both knees of 18 miniature pigs. The 36 knees were randomly assigned to four groups with nine in each group. The defects were initially repaired by autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty. Simultaneously, any empty spaces between the multiple plugs were filled with cell-free poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds (the scaffold group), tissue-engineered cartilage (the TE group) or bone marrow mononuclear cell (BMNC)-PLGA composites (the composite group). The empty spaces were left untreated as control (the control group). Six months after surgery, the repair results were assessed via macroscopic observation, histological evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging, biomechanical assessment and glycosaminoglycan content. The results demonstrated that mosaicplasty combined with the treatment of the empty spaces could improve cartilage regeneration. The filling of empty spaces by tissue-engineered cartilage produced the best result in all the four groups. Meanwhile, utilizing BMNC-PLGA composites achieved a similar repair result. Considering the cost-effective, time-saving and convenient performance, the BMNC-PLGA composite could be an alternative option to fill the empty spaces combined with mosaicplasty.

MSCs secrete factors that can counteract inflammatory and catabolic processes and attract endogenous repair cells. The effects of intra-articular injection of MSC secretome on OA-related pain, cartilage damage, subchondral bone alterations and synovial inflammation were studied in a mouse collagenase-induced OA model. The MSC secretome was generated by stimulating human bone-marrow-derived MSCs with interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). 54 mice were randomly assigned to injections with i) MSC secretome from 20,000 MSCs, ii) 20,000 MSCs or iii) medium (control). Pain was assessed by hind limb weight distribution. Cartilage damage, subchondral bone volume and synovial inflammation were evaluated by histology. MSC-secretome- and MSC-injected mice showed pain reduction at day 7 when compared to control mice. Cartilage damage was more abundant in the control group as compared to healthy knees, a difference which was not found in knees treated with MSC secretome or MSCs. No effects were observed regarding synovial inflammation, subchondral bone volume or the presence of different macrophage subtypes. Injection of MSC secretome, similarly to injection of MSCs, resulted in early pain reduction and had a protective effect on the development of cartilage damage in a murine OA model.

At D60, the proportion of ""hypertrophic"" repair was two fold in Sp/C- group versus Sp/C+ group. As confirmed morphologically and histologically, the T2 map also permitted the distinction of three types of repair tissue: ""total"", ""partial"" and ""hypertrophic"". ""Total"" repair tissue was characterized by high T2 values versus normal cartilage (p<0.05). Zonal variation, reflecting the collagen network organization, appeared only at D60 for Sp/C+ group (p<0.05). ""Hypertrophic"" tissue, mainly observed at D60, presented high T2 global values without zonal variation with cartilage depth. These results confirm the potency of the MR T2 map (8.5 T) to characterize macroscopically and microscopically the patterns of the scaffold guided-tissue repair of a focal chondral lesion in the rat patella (""total"", ""partial"" and ""hypertrophic""). On T2 map, three parameters (i.e. MRI macroscopic pattern, T2 global values and zonal variation of T2 values) permit to characterize chondral repair tissue, as a virtual biopsy.",2004,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The aim of this work was to determine whether repair of critical-size chronic osteochondral defects in an ovine model using MSC-seeded triphasic constructs would show results comparable to osteochondral autografting (OATS). Triphasic implants were engineered using a beta-tricalcium phosphate osseous phase, an intermediate activated plasma phase, and a collagen I hydrogel chondral phase. Autologous MSCs were used to seed the implants, with chondrogenic predifferentiation of the cells used in the cartilage phase. Osteochondral defects of 4.0 mm diameter were created bilaterally in ovine knees (n = 10). Six weeks later, half of the lesions were treated with OATS and half with triphasic constructs. The knees were dissected at 6 or 12 months. With the chosen study design we were not able to demonstrate significant differences between the histological scores of both groups. Subcategory analysis of O'Driscoll scores showed superior cartilage bonding in the 6-month triphasic group compared to the autograft group. The 12-month autograft group showed superior cartilage matrix morphology compared to the 12-month triphasic group.

The formation of hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage may be induced by implanting autologous, cultured chondrocytes into the chondral or osteochondral defect. Autologous chondrocyte implantation may be used for full-thickness chondral or osteochondral injuries which are painful and debilitating with the aim of replacing damaged cartilage with hyaline or hyaline-like cartilage, leading to improved function. The intermediate and long-term functional and clinical results are promising.

The biological environment regulated by the growth factors during the stage of tendon-bone healing was considered important in controlling the integrating process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) genetically modified with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on healing after ACL reconstruction. BMSCs were infected with an adenoviral vector encoding BMP2 (AdBMP2) or bFGF (AdbFGF). Then, the infected BMSCs were surgically implanted into the tendon-bone interface. At 12 weeks postoperatively, the formation of abundant cartilage-like cells, smaller tibial bone tunnel and significantly higher ultimate load and stiffness levels, through histological analysis, micro-computed tomography and biomechanical testing, were observed. In addition, the AdBMP2-plus-AdbFGF group had the smallest bone tunnel and the best mechanical properties among all the groups. The addition of BMP2 or bFGF by gene transfer resulted in better cellularity, new bone formation and higher mechanical property, which contributed to the healing process after ACL reconstruction.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological response to this procedure. Design Patients presenting with symptomatic mono- or bicompartmental arthrosis and varus malalignment underwent IA and concurrent medial open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO). A subset of patients required hardware removal and consented to second-look arthroscopy without biopsy allowing for assessment of IA components and compartment-specific findings related to implant fixation, cartilage flow, propagation of lesions, and opposing tibial surfaces. Results In a series of 41 knees (35 patients) treated with combined IA and HTO (mean varus >7°), 26 knees (23 patients, 18 male, 5 female) with a mean age of 52 years (range = 43-67) required HTO plate removal. Concurrent second look arthroscopy was performed at a mean of 14 months (range = 12-19) following the index procedure. On probing, all arthroplasty components showed solid fixation without gap formation. On the medial femoral condyle, 15 mm implants ( n = 14) showed a peripheral cartilage flow of 12% (range = 5% to 25%), 20 mm implants ( n = 12) of 9% (range 5% to 15%), and trochlear implants ( n = 12) of 20% (range 10% to 40%). No progressive deterioration of the index defects or progression of tibial and retropatellar grades were seen.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autologous BM-MSCs were culture expanded, placed on PR-FG intraoperatively, and then transplanted into 5 full-thickness cartilage defects of femoral condyles of 5 patients and covered with an autologous periosteal flap. Patients were evaluated clinically at 6 and 12 mo by the Lysholm and Revised Hospital for Special Surgery Knee (RHSSK) scores and radiographically by x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the same time points. Repair tissue in 2 patients was rated arthroscopically after 12 mo using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Arthroscopic Score. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; level of evidence 4. RESULTS: All patients' symptoms improved over the follow-up period of 12 mo. Average Lysholm and RHSSK scores for all patients showed statistically significant improvement at 6 and 12 mo postoperatively (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the 6 and 12 mo postoperative clinical scores (P = 0.18). ICRS arthroscopic scores were 8/12 and 11/12 (nearly normal) for the 2 patients who consented to arthroscopy. MRI of 3 patients at 12 mo postoperatively revealed complete defect fill and complete surface congruity with native cartilage, whereas that of 2 patients showed incomplete congruity.

Here, bone marrow was added to the prepared PCL-HA scaffolds and cultured in chondrogenic medium for 10 weeks. Osteochondral defects were created in the trochlear groove of 29 knees in 17 New Zealand white rabbits, which were then divided into four groups that underwent: implantation of PCL-HA scaffolds (left knee, n = 17; Group 1), microfracture (right knee, n = 6; Group 2), autologous osteochondral transplantation (right knee, n = 6; Group 3), and no treatment (right knee, n = 5; Control). Extracellular matrix produced by bone marrow cells covered the surface and filled the pores of PCL-HA scaffolds after 10 weeks in culture. Moreover, many cell-laden cartilage lacunae were observed, and cartilage matrix was concentrated in the PCL-HA scaffolds. After a 12-week repair period, Group 1 showed excellent vertical and lateral integration with host bone, but incomplete cartilage regeneration and matrix accumulation. An uneven surface of regenerated cartilage and reduced distribution of cartilage matrix were observed in Group 2. In addition, abnormal bone growth and unstable integration between repaired and host tissues were detected. For Group 3, the integration between transplanted and host cartilage was interrupted. Our findings indicate that the PCL-HA scaffolds loaded with bone marrow cells improved chondrogenesis in vitro and implantation of PCL-HA scaffolds for osteochondral repairenhanced integration with host bone. However, cartilage regeneration remained unsatisfactory. The addition of trophic factors or the use of precultured cell-PCL-HA constructs for accelerated osteochondral repair requires further investigation.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Thirty two implantations were performed in 31 patients. Clinical outcome was measured using the KOOS score and the 6-minute walk test, as well as an MRI scoring protocol (75% of patients had a complete data set for MRI follow-up) to describe the repair tissue generated by CACI. We have also correlated our MRI results with our clinical outcome. To the authors knowledge there are no comparative studies of MRI and clinical outcome following CACI in the current literature. Patients demonstrated an increased walk distance that improved significantly from 3 months to 24 months postoperatively (p<0.05). Analysis of the KOOS results demonstrated a significant (p<0.05) improvement in four of the five subscales from 3 months to 24 months after CACI, with the most substantial gains made in the first 12 months. Patients demonstrated an increased MRI outcome score over time that improved significantly from 3 months to 24 months postoperatively (p<0.05). We observed an 8% incidence of hypertrophic growth following CACI. We report one partial graft failure, defined by clinical, MRI and histological evaluation, at the one year time point. In contrast to the current literature we report no incidence of manipulation under anesthesia (MUA) following CACI. This research demonstrates that autologous chondrocytes implanted under a type I/III collagen patch regenerates a functional infill material, and as a result of this procedure, patients experienced improved knee function and MRI scores. Whilst our results indicated a statistically significant relationship between the MRI and functional outcome following CACI, MRI cannot be used as surrogate measure of functional outcome following CACI, since the degree of association was only low to moderate. That is, functional outcome following CACI cannot be predicted by the morphological MRI assessment of the repair tissue at the post-surgery time points to 24 months.",2007,Jeyaraman_2020,0

As bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) have the capacity to make both bone-like and cartilage-like tissues, they are an ideal cell population for use in the manufacture of osteochondral tissues. Effective differentiation of MSC to bone-like and cartilage-like tissues requires two unique medium formulations and this presents a challenge both in achieving initial MSC differentiation and in maintaining tissue stability when the unified osteochondral tissue is subsequently cultured in a single medium formulation. In this proof-of-principle study, we used an in-house fabricated microwell platform to manufacture thousands of micropellets formed from 166 MSC each. We then characterized the development of bone-like and cartilage-like tissue formation in the micropellets maintained for 8-14 days in sequential combinations of osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium. When bone-like or cartilage-like micropellets were induced for only 8 days, they displayed significant phenotypic changes when the osteogenic or chondrogenic induction medium, respectively, was swapped. Based on these data, we developed an extended 14-day protocol for the pre-culture of bone-like and cartilage-like micropellets in their respective induction medium. Unified osteochondral tissues were formed by layering 12,000 osteogenic micropellets and 12,000 chondrogenic micropellets into a biphasic structure and then further culture in chondrogenic induction medium. The assembled tissue was cultured for a further 8 days and characterized via histology. The micropellets had amalgamated into a continuous structure with distinctive bone-like and cartilage-like regions.

Nonetheless, recent studies have not shown good long-term clinical outcomes, and MF has produced alterations in the subchondral bone architecture with degenerative changes. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has shown good results at 20 years. Second- and third-generation ACI has shown superiority to MF and fewer complications than first-generation ACI. Each treatment option has its advantages and disadvantages. Recent research has shown that better filling of cartilage tissue occurs in patients treated with MF and collagen augmentation than in those treated with MF alone. Research from our clinic has shown that Hyaff scaffold combined with bone marrow aspirate concentrate in a 1-step technique yielded good results in patients with 10 years' follow-up.

22036244,Treatment of knee cartilage defect in 2010.,"G Versier, F Dubrana","Treatment of knee cartilage defect, a true challenge, should not only reconstruct hyaline cartilage on a long-term basis, but also be able to prevent osteoarthritis. Osteochondral knee lesions occur in either traumatic lesions or in osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). These lesions can involve all the articular surfaces of the knee in its three compartments. In principle, this review article covers symptomatic ICRS grade C or D lesions, depth III and IV, excluding management of superficial lesions, asymptomatic lesions that are often discovered unexpectedly, and kissing lesions, which arise prior to or during osteoarthritis. For clarity sake, the international classifications used are reviewed, for both functional assessment (ICRS and functional IKDC for osteochondral fractures, Hughston for osteochondritis) and morphological lesion evaluations (the ICRS macroscopic evaluation for fractures, the Bedouelle or SOFCOT for osteochondritis, and MOCART for MRI). The therapeutic armamentarium to treat these lesions is vast, but accessibility varies greatly depending on the country and the legislation in effect. Many comparative studies have been conducted, but they are rarely of high scientific quality; the center effect is nearly constant because patients are often referred to certain centers for an expert opinion. The indications defined herein use algorithms that take into account the size of the cartilage defect and the patient's functional needs for cases of fracture and the vitality, stability, and size of the fragment for cases of osteochondritis dissecans. Fractures measuring less than 2 cm(2) are treated with either microfracturing or mosaic osteochondral grafting, between 2 and 4 cm(2) with microfractures covered with a membrane or a culture of second- or third-generation chondrocytes, and beyond this size, giant lesions are subject to an exceptional allografting procedure, harvesting from the posterior condyle, or chondrocyte culture on a 3D matrix to restore volume. Cases of stable osteochondritis dissecans with closed articular cartilage can be simply monitored or treated with perforation in cases of questionable vitality. Cases of open joint cartilage are treated with a PLUS fixation if their vitality is preserved; if not, they are treated comparably to osteochondral fractures, with the type of filling depending on the defect size.",2011,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Many approaches attempt to increase the number of matrix-producing cells that can migrate to the interface, which may help to reinforce the boundary over time but does not address the problems associated with an initially unstable interface. The objective of this study was to develop a bioadhesive implant to create an immediate bond with the extracellular matrix components of articular cartilage. We hypothesized that implant-bound collagen adhesion protein (CNA) would increase the interfacial strength between a poly(vinly alcohol) implant and an articular cartilage immediately after implantation, without preventing cell migration into the implant. By way of a series of in vitro immunohistochemical and mechanical experiments, we demonstrated that (i) free CNA can bind to articular cartilage, (ii) implant-bound CNA can bind to collagen type II and (iii) implants functionalized with CNA result in a fourfold increase in interfacial strength with cartilage relative to untreated implants at day zero. Of note, the interfacial strength significantly decreased after 21 days in culture, which may be an indication that the protein itself has lost its effectiveness. Our data suggest that functionalizing scaffolds with CNA may be a viable approach toward creating an initially stable interface between scaffolds and articular cartilage. Further efforts are required to ensure long-term interface stability.",2012,Jeyaraman_2020,0

To overcome these limitations, we constructed a functional biomaterial using a biphasic scaffold platform and a bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)-specific affinity peptide. The biphasic scaffold platform retains more cells homogeneously within the sol-gel transition of chitosan and provides sufficient solid matrix strength. This biphasic scaffold platform is functionalized with an affinity peptide targeting a cell source of interest, BMSCs. The presence of conjugated peptide gives this system a biological functionality towards BMSC-specific homing both in vitro and in vivo. The functional biomaterial can stimulate stem cell proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation during in vitro culture. Six months after in vivo implantation, compared with routine surgery or control scaffolds, the functional biomaterials induced superior cartilage repair without complications, as indicated by histological observations, magnetic resonance imaging and biomechanical properties. Beyond cartilage repair, this functional biphasic scaffold may provide a biomaterial framework for one-step tissue engineering strategy by homing endogenous cells to stimulate tissue regeneration.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Several surgical techniques for regeneration of the articular cartilage have been proposed. Among them, osteochondral autograft transplantation and 2-step procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation have provided good results, promoting formation of new hyaline-like cartilage tissue, whereas other techniques such as microfracture result in fibrous cartilage and a less durable repair. Single-stage cell-based procedures are an attractive treatment option given the potential for cost savings and avoiding a second-stage procedure. We believe that 1-stage cartilage repair in the knee with a hyaluronic acid-based scaffold embedded with mesenchymal stem cells sourced from bone marrow aspirate concentrate has a prominent role in treating chondral defects because this is a simple technique that could improve the care of patients and be cost-effective in the near future.",2020,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Cartilage biopsies were taken from the non-load-bearing area of the lateral talus of the left tibiotarsal joint of eight healthy Haflinger horses. Tissue engineering cartilage transplants were generated by three-dimensional arrangement of autologous chondrocytes in biocompatible and resorbable polymer scaffolds. Full-thickness cartilage defects of 8 mm in diameter were created in the tubular bone condyle of the fetlock joint and cartilage grafts were fixed using an anchor system, while defects without grafting served as controls. After 6 and 12 months the repair tissue was evaluated histologically and showed formation of a cartilaginous tissue and good integration into the surrounding host tissue with firm bonding of the graft to the adjacent cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the content of glycosaminoglycans and hydroxyproline is comparable in repair tissue derived from treated and control defects. The use of three-dimensional autologous cartilage transplants based on resorbable polymer scaffolds ensures secure fixation, good integration of the graft into cartilage lesions, and is therefore suggested as a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of cartilage defects.",2006,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The type of study was case series. From October 1990 to June 1995, eight cases underwent allogenic or autogenic meniscus transplantations for articular cartilage defects, and seven cases were available for follow-up evaluations. The age at surgery ranged from 14 to 42 years of age (average 22.5). In one case, transplantation of tissue-engineered cartilage was performed due to pain 5 years after surgery. The other six cases were followed up for 8-13 years (average 10.1). The size of the cartilage defect ranged from 1.0 to 6.3 cm2 (average 2.8 cm2). Patients were evaluated with the Lysholm score and MR images. We also performed arthroscopic examinations in three cases at the final evaluation. This study leads to the conclusion that meniscus transplantation for articular cartilage damage is not comparable to autologous chondrocyte transplantation.

The TEC derived from the synovial MSCs was implanted into chondral defects in the medial femoral condyle of the knee. The integration boundary of repair tissue with the adjacent host cartilage was morphologically and biomechanically evaluated at 6 months post-implantation. Histological assessments showed that the repair tissue in each zone was well integrated with the adjacent host cartilage, with an apparent secure continuity of the extracellular matrix. There were no significant differences in histological scores between the integration boundary and the center of the repair tissue at every zone. Nonetheless, in all the specimens subjected to mechanical testing, failure occurred at the integration boundary. The average tensile strength of the integration boundary vs normal cartilage was 0.6 vs 4.9, 3.0 vs 12.6, and 5.5 vs 12.8MPa at the superficial, middle, and deep layers, respectively. Thus, these results indicate the most fragile point in the repair tissue remained at the integration boundary in spite of the apparent secure tissue continuity and equivalent histological quality with the center of the repair tissue. Such tissue vulnerability at the surface integration boundary could affect the long-term durability of the tissue repair, and thus, special consideration will be needed in the post-operative rehabilitation programming to enhance the longevity of such repair tissues in response to normal knee loading.",2015,Jeyaraman_2020,0

While tissue-engineered cartilage constructs have shown efficacy in repairing focal cartilage defects in animal models, a substantial number of cells are required to generate sufficient quantities of tissue for the repair of larger defects. In a previous study, we developed a novel approach to generate large, scaffold-free cartilaginous constructs from a small number of donor cells (20 000 cells to generate a 3-cm(2) tissue construct). As comparable thicknesses to native cartilage could be achieved, the purpose of the present study was to assess the ability of these constructs to survive implantation as well as their potential for the repair of critical-sized chondral defects in a rabbit model. Evaluated up to 6 months post-implantation, allogenic constructs survived weight bearing without a loss of implant fixation. Implanted constructs appeared to integrate near-seamlessly with the surrounding native cartilage and also to extensively remodel with increasing time in vivo. By 6 months post-implantation, constructs appeared to adopt both a stratified (zonal) appearance and a biochemical composition similar to native articular cartilage. In addition, constructs that expressed superficial zone markers displayed higher histological scores, suggesting that transcriptional prescreening of constructs prior to implantation may serve as an approach to achieve superior and/or more consistent reparative outcomes. As the results of this initial animal study were encouraging, future studies will be directed toward the repair of chondral defects in more mechanically demanding anatomical locations.",2014,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Methods The CRD was press-fit into defects (10 mm diameter, 10 mm deep) created in the femoral trochlea of 12 horses. In the contralateral limb, 10 mm diameter full-thickness chondral defects were treated with microfracture (MFX). Radiographs were obtained pre- and postoperatively, and at 4, 12, and 24 months. Repeat arthroscopy was performed at 4 and 12 months. Gross assessment, histology, mechanical testing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at 24 months. Results The CRD was easily placed arthroscopically. There was no evidence of joint infection, inflammation, or degeneration. CRD-treated defects had significantly more sclerosis compared to MFX early ( P = 0.0006), but was not different at 24 months. CRD had better arthroscopic scores at 4 months compared to MFX ( P = 0.0069). At 24 months, there was no difference in repair tissue on histology or mechanical testing. Based on MRI, CRD repair tissue had less proteoglycan (deep P = 0.027, superficial P = 0.015) and less organized collagen (deep P = 0.028) compared to MFX. Cartilage surrounding MFX defects had more fissures compared to CRD. Conclusion The repair tissue formed after CRD treatment of a large osteochondral lesion is fibrocartilage similar to that formed in simple chondral defects treated with MFX. The CRD can be easily placed arthroscopically, is safe, and biocompatible for 24 months. The CRD results in improved early arthroscopic repair scores and may limit fissure formation in adjacent cartilage.",2017,Jeyaraman_2020,0

An alternative may be to use mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). We have compared articular chondrocytes with MSC from human bone marrow (BM) and adipose tissue (AT), all cultured in HA scaffolds, for their ability to express genes and synthesize proteins associated with chondrogenesis. The cells were expanded in monolayer cultures. After seeding into the scaffold, the chondrocytes were maintained in medium, while the two MSC populations were given a chondrogenic differentiation medium. Chondrogenesis was assessed by real-time RT-PCR for chondrocyte-associated genes, by immunohistochemistry and by ELISA for collagens in the supernatant. Redifferentiation of the dedifferentiated chondrocytes in the HA scaffold was shown by a modest increase in type II collagen mRNA (COL2A1) and reduction in COL1A1. BM-MSC expressed 600-fold higher levels of COL2A1 than chondrocytes after 3 weeks in the scaffold. The levels of aggrecan (AGC1) and COL1A1 were similar for chondrocyte and BM-MSC scaffold cultures, while COL10A1 was higher in the BM-MSC. AT-MSC expressed levels of COL2A1 and COL1A1 similar to chondrocytes, but less AGC1 and COL10A1. Surprisingly, little collagen II protein was observed in the scaffold. Instead, collagen II was found in the culture medium. Chondrogenesis in HA scaffolds was more efficient using BM-MSC than AT-MSC or chondrocytes.

Here, we report the development of a novel tricalcium phosphate-collagen-hyaluronate (TCP-COL-HA) scaffold that can function as a stem cell carrier to induce chondrogenesis and promote cartilage repair, and the investigation of chondroinductive properties of scaffolds containing varying amounts of TCP, COL and HA. TCP-COL-HA scaffolds, as well as TCP-COL scaffolds at two different TCP/COL ratios (50:50 and 25:75), were evaluated for their ability to induce cartilage regeneration from rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Chondrogenic differentiation was evaluated by sulphated glycosaminoglycan quantification, collagen type II immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. Mechanical strength was evaluated by the compression test. The results showed that the TCP-COL-HA scaffolds enhanced rMSC chondrogenesis to a greater degree than did the TCP-COL scaffolds; for the latter, the scaffold with the lower TCP/COL ratio (25:75) was superior in terms of promoting rMSC chondrogenesis. Similar results were obtained in an ectopic implantation model in nude mice. In a critical-size rabbit osteochondral defect-repair model, rMSCs seeded on TCP-COL-HA scaffolds showed greater cartilage regeneration and integration into surrounding tissue than the TCP-COL groups, in which cartilage repair was more efficient at the 25:75 than at the 50:50 ratio. These results indicate that the addition of HA and different TCP/COL ratios can affect the chondroinductive capacity of scaffolds, and suggest that the TCP-COL-HA scaffold can serve as an effective cell carrier for cartilage regeneration.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0

To this aim, we tested microspheres releasing TGFβ3 (PAM-T) in vitro and in situ, in a pathological osteoarthritic (OA) environment. We first evaluated the chondrogenic differentiation of human MSCs seeded onto PAM-T in vitro and confirmed the up-regulation of chondrogenic markers while the secretome of the cells was not changed by the 3D environment. We then injected human MSC seeded onto PAM-T in the knee joints of mice with collagenase-induced OA. After 6 weeks, histological analysis revealed that formation of a cartilage-like tissue occurred at the vicinity of PAM-T that was not observed when MSCs were seeded onto PAM. We also noticed that the endogenous articular cartilage was less degraded. The extent of cartilage protection was further analysed by confocal laser microscopy. When MSCs seeded onto PAM-T were injected early after OA induction, protection of cartilage against degradation was evidenced and this effect was associated to a higher survival of MSCs in presence of TGFβ3. This study points to the interest of using MSCs seeded onto PAM for cartilage repair and stimulation of endogenous cartilage regeneration.",2016,Jeyaraman_2020,0
27994717,Evaluation and Management of Osteochondral Lesions of the Talus.,"Christopher A Looze, Jason Capo, Michael K Ryan, John P Begly, Cary Chapman, David Swanson, Brian C Singh, Eric J Strauss","Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common injuries that affect a wide variety of active patients. The majority of these lesions are associated with ankle sprains and fractures though several nontraumatic etiologies have also been recognized. Patients normally present with a history of prior ankle injury and/or instability. In addition to standard ankle radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are used to characterize the extent of the lesion and involvement of the subchondral bone. Symptomatic nondisplaced lesions can often be treated conservatively within the pediatric population though this treatment is less successful in adults. Bone marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture have yielded favorable results for the treatment of small (<15 mm) lesions. Osteochondral autograft can be harvested most commonly from the ipsilateral knee and carries the benefit of repairing defects with native hyaline cartilage. Osteochondral allograft transplant is reserved for large cystic lesions that lack subchondral bone integrity. Cell-based repair techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation have been increasingly used in an attempt to repair the lesion with hyaline cartilage though these techniques require adequate subchondral bone. Biological agents such as platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow aspirate have been more recently studied as an adjunct to operative treatment but their use remains theoretical.

Both autologous chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds and non-seeded scaffolds were implanted into two defects located in the non-weight-bearing zone of the femoral trochlea (defect A was located more distally and medially, defect B was located more proximally and laterally). Control defects were left untreated. Twelve weeks after the operation, the knees were evaluated in vivo using MRI. Six months after the implantation, the defects were analyzed using MRI, histological, and immunohistochemical analysis. In the A defects of chondrocyte-seeded scaffold group, hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage was formed, containing type II collagen, acidic and neutral glycosaminoglycans while the non-seeded scaffold group was predominantly filled with fibrocartilage. Defects in the control group were predominantly filled with fibrous tissue. Histomorphometric analysis of photomicrographs revealed a significantly higher amount of hyaline cartilage in the cell-seeded scaffold group in A defects than in other groups.

This procedure borrows marrow stimulation treatment principles and techniques from knee arthroscopy, with similar mixed clinical outcomes that may be more favorable in the short term (<2 years) and poorer in the long term. Despite these varied outcomes, microfracture remains the most frequently used technique to treat small focal chondral defects because of the relative ease and cost-effectiveness of the procedure. Consequently, recent efforts have been aimed at improving or augmenting traditional microfracture to achieve more consistent success. BioCartilage (Arthrex, Naples, FL) is a biologically active scaffold containing allograft cartilage that, when combined with autologous conditioned platelet-rich plasma and placed in a defect in which microfracture was performed, may provide a superior repair that mimics native hyaline cartilage rather than the less-durable fibrocartilage that is formed with microfracture alone.

All patients (six men, two women; mean age 43.1 years) were documented prospectively. In each patient the stage of the osteochondral lesion was Outerbridge grade IV with a mean size of the affected area of 150 mm2. All patients were assessed by using the Constant score for the shoulder and the Lysholm score for the knee. Standard radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and second-look arthroscopy were used to assess the presence of glenohumeral osteoarthritis and the integrity of the grafts. After a mean of 32.6 months (8 to 47), the mean Constant score increased significantly. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed good osseointegration of the osteochondral plugs and congruent articular cartilage at the transplantation site in all but one patient. Second-look arthroscopy performed in two cases revealed a macroscopically good integration of the autograft with an intact articular surface.

If left untreated, such an injury may progress to osteoarthritis, a degenerative and debilitating joint disease characterized by pain and functional impairment. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have immune-modulatory properties and the ability to differentiate into chondroblasts and osteoblasts, are a predictable source for the treatment of cartilage injuries. This article presents tools to evaluate cartilage restoration by tissue engineering and cell therapy treatment in a translational and preclinical large animal model. In this controlled experimental study with 14 miniature pigs, a scaffold-free tissue engineering construct (TEC) derived from dental pulp and synovial MSCs for cartilage therapy was tested. Total thickness cartilage defects were performed in both posterior knees. The defect was left empty in one of the knees, and the other received the TEC. The tissue repair was morphologically assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using the three-dimensional double echo steady-state (3D-DESS) sequence, and compositional assessment was carried out based on the T2 mapping technique. The osteochondral specimens were fixed for histopathology, decalcified, subjected to standard histological processing, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sections stained for immunohistochemical detection of collagen types were digested with pepsin and chondroitinase and incubated with antibodies against them. The mechanical evaluation involved analysis of Young's modulus of the cartilage samples based on the indentation and maximum compression test. In addition, a finite element model was used to simulate and characterize properties of the osteochondral block. At 6 months after surgery, there were no complications with the animals and the MRI, histological, immunohistochemical, and biomechanical evaluations proved to be effective and qualified to differentiate good quality chondral repair from inadequate repair tissue. The proposed methods were feasible and capable to properly evaluate the defect filled with TEC containing stromal cells after 6 months of follow-up in a large animal model for articular cartilage restoration. Impact Statement Articular chondral injuries are prevalent and represent an economic burden due to the cost of treatment. The engineering of cartilage tissue can promote the repair of chondral injuries and is dependent on selecting appropriate cells and biocompatible frameworks. In this article, methods for evaluation of a scaffold-free cell delivery system made from mesenchymal stromal cells were present in a translational study that allows further clinical safety and efficacy trials.",2022,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Porcine synovial MSCs were cultured in monolayer at high density and were subsequently detached from the substratum. The cell/matrix complex spontaneously contracted to develop a basic TEC. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the basic TEC contained collagen I and III, fibronectin, and vitronectin. The basic TEC exhibited stable adhesion to the surface of a porcine cartilage matrix in an explant culture system. The TEC cultured in chondrogenic media exhibited elevated expression of glycosaminoglycan and chondrogenic marker genes. The TEC were implanted in vivo into chondral defects in the medial femoral condyle of 4-month-old pigs, followed by sacrifice after 6 months. Implantation of a TEC into chondral defects initiated repair with a chondrogenic-like tissue, as well as secure biological integration to the adjacent cartilage. Histologically, the repair tissue stained positively with Safranin O and for collagen II.

Current osteochondral repair grafts are limited in availability and often fail due to insufficient osseous support and integration. Thus, a need exists for an off-the-shelf osteochondral construct with the propensity to overcome these shortcomings. Herein, a scalable process was used to develop a multi-layered osteochondral graft with a subchondral bone (ScB) phase tailored to support bone healing and integration. Multiple ScB formulations and fabrication techniques were screened via degradation, bioactivity, and unconfined compression testing. An optimized ScB construct was selected and its cytotoxicity assessed. Additionally, a cartilage analog was secured to the optimized ScB construct via a calcified cartilage layer, and the resulting osteochondral construct was characterized via interfacial shear and dynamic mechanical testing. The optimized ScB construct did not significantly alter local pH during degradation, exhibited measurable bioactivity in vitro, and had significantly greater compressive mechanical strength compared to other constructs. The attachment strength of the cartilage analog was significantly greater by an increase in compressive dynamic mechanical properties. Furthermore, this ScB construct was found to be cytocompatible with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Taken together, this optimized ScB material forms the robust foundation of a novel, off-the-shelf osteochondral construct to be used in defect repair.",2018,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Twenty-four patients (mean age 29.9±8.7, 70.8% male) undergoing arthroscopic OAT between 1997 and 2000 were prospectively enrolled. The International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS)/International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores and Tegner scores were employed for clinical evaluation. The magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) was utilized for description and assessment of the repair tissue. Median follow up was 113 months (interquartile range [IQR] 106-122). MRI showed good survival of grafted cartilage in 62.5% of patients. The integration of the graft was complete in 75% of cases, while the repaired tissue was intact in 62.5% and had an homogeneous structure in 70.8%. The MOCART score significantly correlated with objective and subjective scores (p=0.003 and p=0.002). Contrastingly, overall MOCART showed no correlation with the Tegner score. MRI revealed to be a powerful tool for non-invasive long-term assessment of OAT.",2010,Jeyaraman_2020,0

The study population comprised 22 patients (mean age: 39 years), prospectively assessed before surgery, at 24 and 60 months' follow-up. Inclusion criteria were: at least two episodes of knee pain for more than 10 days in the last year, Kellgren-Lawrence OA grade 0, I or II and arthroscopic or MRI findings according to the European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery & Arthroscopy (ESSKA) criteria. Clinical results demonstrated significant improvement in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective and objective scores and in Tegner score, although activity level never reached the pre-injury level. The complication rate of this study was 8.3%. Two patients underwent re-operation (8.3%), while a comprehensive definition of failure (including both surgical and clinical criteria) identified four failed patients (16.6%) at this mid-term follow-up evaluation. The use of a free-cell osteochondral scaffold represented a safe and valid alternative for the treatment of focal articular cartilage defects in the setting of an EOA, and was able to permit a significant clinical improvement and stable outcome with low complication and failure rates.",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0
31604490,How to Manage Cartilage Injuries?,"Jorge Chahla, Jonathan Stone, Bert R Mandelbaum","Although small cartilage injuries are commonly found in knee arthroscopy procedures, significant chondral and osteochondral injuries are relatively infrequent. Incidence of cartilage injury rises when considering traumatic origin, especially when approaching significant ligamentous or meniscal pathology. Options for restoration span the gamut from benign neglect to open procedures that restore both cartilage and subchondral bone. The best choice of procedure largely depends on lesion size, depth, and location. Smaller lesions isolated to cartilage <2 cm",2019,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Although joint function improves following microfracture, the procedure elicits incomplete repair. As blood clot formation in the microfracture defect is an essential initiating event in microfracture therapy, we hypothesized that the repair would be improved if the microfracture defect were filled with a blood clot that was stabilized by the incorporation of a thrombogenic and adhesive polymer, specifically, chitosan. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate (1) blood clot adhesion in fresh microfracture defects and (2) the quality of the repair, at six months postoperatively, of microfracture defects that had been treated with or without chitosan-glycerol phosphate/blood clot implants, using a sheep model.",2005,Jeyaraman_2020,0

Autologous osteochondral mosaic transplantation technique is one of the recently evolved methods to create hyaline or hyaline-like repair tissue in the pathologic area. Clinical evaluation, various imaging techniques, arthroscopy (second look), histological examination of biopsy samples, and measurements of cartilage mechanical properties are used to evaluate the merits of outcomes and quality of the transplanted cartilage. According to our investigations, good to excellent results were achieved in more than 92% of patients treated with femoral condylar implantations, 87% of those treated with tibial resurfacing, 79% of those treated with patellar and/or trochlear mosaicplasties, and 94% of those treated with talar procedures. Long-term donor-site discrepancies, assessed with use of the Bandi Score, showed that patients had 3% morbidity after mosaicplasty. Sixty-nine of 89 patients who were followed up with a second-look arthroscopy showed congruent gliding surfaces, histological evidence of the survival of the transplanted hyaline cartilage, and fibrocartilage filling of the donor sites. In a series of 831 consecutive patients, very few complications have been observed. These included 4 deep infections and 36 painful postoperative intra-articular bleedings. On the basis of these results and those of other similar studies, autologous osteochondral mosaicplasty appears to be a promising alternative for the treatment of small- and medium-sized focal chondral and osteochondral defects of the weight-bearing surfaces of the knee and other weight-bearing synovial joints.",2006,Jeyaraman_2020,0

9785259,Treatment of articular cartilage defects of the knee with autologous chondrocyte implantation.,"S D Gillogly, M Voight, T Blackburn","The treatment of focal full thickness articular defects in the knee has continued to present a challenge, with no traditional treatment method providing consistent acceptable long-term clinical results. Patients with significant chondral defects frequently have persistent joint line pain, swelling, and catching in the knee. In contrast to marrow stimulation treatment techniques, such as abrasion arthroplasty, drilling, or microfracture which populate the defect with pluripotential stem cells, the use of cultured autologous chondrocytes fills the defect with cells of a committed pathway to develop hyaline-like cartilage. This hyaline-like cartilage more closely recreates the wear characteristics and durability of normal hyaline cartilage than the fibrous or fibrocartilage repair tissue formed by pluripotential stem cells. The purpose of this paper is to review the efficacy of available treatment options as well as the basic science rationale, indications, technique, postoperative rehabilitation, and clinical results of using cultured autologous chondrocytes in the treatment of focal full thickness chondral defects of the knee.",1998,Jeyaraman_2020,0

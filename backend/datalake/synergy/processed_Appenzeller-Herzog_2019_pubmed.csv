15516801,[Wilson's disease and its pharmacological treatment].,"Hisao Hayashi, Rie Suzuki, Shinya Wakusawa","Wilson's disease is an inherited copper toxicosis caused by defective putative copper transporting ATPase in the liver. Because of impaired biliary secretion, copper remains in the liver, resulting in chronic hepatic lesions including fatty metamorphosis, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. In the latter stage, extrapyramidal syndromes may develop with and without symptomatic hepatic lesions. Acute liver damage associated with hemolysis and deep jaundice may be the first manifestation. The majority of patients show hypoceruloplasminemia, which has been used as a screening test for the disease. A large number of mutations in the ATP7B gene have been reported. Thus, genetic diagnosis might be limitedly used to presymptomatic diagnosis of siblings when mutations are identified in an index patient. Introduction of penicillamine caused a revolution in the treatment of patients. Another chelater, trientine, is now available for those intolerant of penicillamine. Tetrathiomolibdate and zinc acetate are additional alternatives currently being tested. Hypoceruloplasminemia and further reduction after chelation therapy may be associated with iron overload. This complication is closely related with impaired transport of ferrous ion due to ferroxidase deficiency. Noncompliance and teratogenicity are other major concerns because any treatment with the agents listed above is a life long regimen. Despite various side effects of penicillamine, its teratogenicity is negligible. These data indicate that penicillamine is the first choice of drug for this disease.",2004,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Their eminent treatability makes diagnosis in adolescence or young adulthood critical. WD is the result of abnormal copper homeostasis, causing copper overload and end-organ damage. Chelation therapy can be highly efficacious in preventing manifestations of WD. HH is caused by inappropriate absorption of dietary iron, typically as the result of a specific mutation, C282Y, in the HFE gene.

It is generally accepted that ""presymptomatic"" patients--in whom WD is diagnosed in childhood and who are defined as those who, although still asymptomatic, do have liver disease, as indicated by increased serum concentrations of transaminases--should be treated prophylactically. Here we report our results in 22 children treated with continuous oral zinc therapy for 10 years. Zinc sulfate was administered at a dosage of 25 mg elemental zinc twice a day until the age of 6 years, 25 mg three times a day between the ages of 7 and 16 years or until the child attained a body weight of 125 lb, and 50 mg three times a day thereafter. Five years after the start of zinc treatment, we noted highly significant decreases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and urinary copper excretion, but white blood cell counts did not vary significantly. Six of 22 patients continued to demonstrate greater-than-normal ALT concentrations and only 1 patient demonstrated an ALT concentration more than 1.5 times the upper normal limit. Further decreases in ALT, AST, and urinary copper excretion were observed at the end of the 10-year follow-up, but these decreases were not statistically significant. Only 1 patient continued to demonstrate abnormal ALT levels. Again, white blood cells showed no significant variations. All histologic scores (steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis) were significantly decreased after treatment. Hepatic copper content was also significantly decreased, although it remained higher than normal in all patients. The removal of toxic copper was confirmed by disappearance of Kayser-Fleischer rings in 3 patients. Zinc did not have adverse effects on growth. The efficacy of zinc in WD in presymptomatic pediatric patients has been established in previous studies, and our study adds considerably to the earlier findings because it includes a large number of very young children, as many as 11 younger than 6 years and 20 younger than 10. The excellent clinical results in all patients, coupled with the improvement in hepatic histologic findings in the vast majority, indicate convincingly that zinc treatment can control the disease effectively and safely, preventing its progression over the course of 10 years. Histologic findings reportedly improved in 3 patients treated in an earlier study, but our data are numerically much more relevant. Notably, histologic study of the liver revealed that copper concentration was reduced by treatment, suggesting that oral zinc was able not only to prevent further accumulation of copper but also to promote, at least in part, the depletion of its stores. The lack of adverse effects of zinc on growth suggests that our patients received enough anticopper therapy to prevent damage resulting from copper toxicity but an adequate amount of copper for proper growth and development. In conclusion, our findings indicate that zinc is the treatment of choice in presymptomatic pediatric patients with WD.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

16594644,Role of animal models in the study of drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions.,Jack Uetrecht,"Drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) are a major problem, in large part because of their unpredictable nature. If we understood the mechanisms of these reactions better, they might be predictable. Their unpredictable nature also makes mechanistic studies very difficult, especially prospective clinical studies. Animal models are vital to most biomedical research, and they are almost the only way to test basic hypotheses of DHRs, such as the involvement of reactive metabolites. However, useful animal models of DHRs are rare because DHRs are also unpredictable in animals. For example, sulfonamide-induced DHRs in large-breed dogs appear to be valid because they are very similar to the DHRs that occur in humans; however, the incidence is only approximately 0.25%, and large-breed dogs are difficult to use as an animal model. Two more practical models are penicillamine-induced autoimmunity in the Brown Norway rat and nevirapine-induced skin rash in rats. The toxicity in these models is clearly immune mediated. In other models, such as amodiaquine-induced agranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity and halothane-induced hepatotoxicity, the drug induces an immune response but there is no clinical toxicity. This finding suggests that regulatory mechanisms usually limit toxicity. Many of the basic characteristics of the penicillamine and nevirapine models, such as memory and tolerance, are quite different suggesting that the mechanisms are also significantly different. More animal models are needed to study the range of mechanisms involved in DHRs; without them, progress in understanding such reactions is likely to be slow.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Although these metals are essential, they can be toxic at excess amounts, especially in certain genetic disorders. Zinc and copper homeostasis results from a coordinated regulation by different proteins involved in uptake, excretion and intracellular storage/trafficking of these metals. Apart from zinc transporters (ZnT) families and Cu-ATPase, metallothionein is an important storage protein for zinc and copper. Metallothioneins are intracellular polypeptides with a remarkable ability to bind metallic ions. These proteins bind both essential metals indispensable for the organism and also toxic metals (e.g. cadmium or lead). Metallothioneins play a critical role to maintain zinc and copper homeostasis. In this review, we summarize the toxicity of zinc and copper and the potential treatment for zinc or copper toxicity by zinc- or copper-specific chelators as well as strategy to up-regulate metallothionein.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
16313864,Hepatic Wilson's disease: initial treatment and long-term management.,J M Walshe,"This article is based on the experience of 320 patients with Wilson's disease who were seen between the years 1954 and 2000. These patients were seen at The Boston City Hospital, 1954 thru 1955, University College Hospital, London,1955 thru 1957; Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, 1967 thru 1987, and The Middlesex Hospital London, 1988 thru 2000. Wilson's disease is not strictly a gastroenterologic disease but a genetically determined metabolic disease that is mediated by a failure of copper excretion through the bile. The mutation carried on chromosome 13q14.3: it involves a copper-carrying ATPase (ATPase 7B); more than 250 mutations are now known. The first organ to be affected is the liver, then many other tissues, principally the brain but also the eyes, the kidneys, the bone marrow, and the osteoskeletal system. It is with the hepatic form of the disease that this article is concerned. The hepatic illness may be acute, subacute or chronic; it may be progressive or, apparently, self-limiting. In 10% of patients hemolysis may also be found which can later lead to the formation of pigment gallstones. The management of liver disease is not considered in this article, which is strictly confined to the therapeutic options available for the elimination of copper and the long-term welfare of the patient. It must be remembered that all close relatives of the patient must be screened for the presymptomatic stage of the disease so, if they are found to be homozygous carriers for the mutation, they can be started on preventive treatment.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Copper accumulated in the kidneys of LEC rats in an age-dependent manner from 12 to 18 weeks of age. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, renal copper contents did not increase and were maintained at the same levels as those in 4-week-old LEC rats. Estimation of the amounts of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) by comet assay showed that SSBs of DNA were induced in a substantial population of LEC rat renal cortex cells around 12 weeks of age and that the amounts of SSBs increased in an age-dependent manner from 12 to 18 weeks of age. When LEC rats were treated with trientine from 10 weeks of age, the observed number of cells with DNA damage decreased, suggesting that induction of SSBs of DNA was inhibited and/or SSBs were repaired during the period of treatment with trientine.

16222684,Homozygosity for a gross partial gene deletion of the C-terminal end of ATP7B in a Wilson patient with hepatic and no neurological manifestations.,"Lisbeth Birk Møller, Peter Ott, Connie Lund, Nina Horn","We identified a partial gene deletion of ATP7B in a patient with Wilson disease with hepatic onset. The deletion covered exon 20 including major parts of the flanking introns. The breakpoints were identified and the size of the deletion determined to be 2144 bp. The deletion is predicted to lead to a mutated protein product containing 45 aberrant amino acids after transmembrane domain 7, and lacking the transmembrane domain 8 as well as the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. This is the first time a partial gene deletion has been demonstrated in ATP7B. The patient presented at age 10 with hepatic manifestations, including severe jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly, ascites, and spider naevi. The liver biopsy showed fibrosis and early signs of cirrhosis. There was a Kayser-Fleischer ring but no neurological manifestations. All symptoms disappeared with penicillamine therapy. This suggests that the C-terminal cytoplasmatic tail of ATP7B, is not essential for its neurological function. Large deletions in ATP7B may be an overlooked cause of Wilson disease. Patients that are homozygotes for deletions may be valuable for the understanding of the function of various regions of the ATP7B protein.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Four-week-old LEC (N=64) and control Long-Evans (LE) (N=32) female rats were divided into two groups; one group was fed with a Zn-supplemented diet (group I) and the other was given a normal rodent diet (group II). LEC rats were killed at 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 20 wk of age; the LE control rats were killed at 6, 12, 18, and 20 wk of age. Cu concentration in the liver was reduced in LEC rats fed the Zn-supplemented diet compared with LEC rats on the normal diet between 6 and 18 wk of age. Metallothionein (MT) concentration in the livers of LEC rats in group I increased between 12 and 20 wk of age, whereas hepatic MT concentration in LEC rats from group II decreased after 12 wk. Hepatocyte apoptosis, as determined by TUNEL, was reduced in Zn-supplemented LEC rats at all ages. Cholangiocellular carcinoma was observed only in LEC rats in group II at wk 20. These results suggest that Zn supplementation can reduce hepatic Cu concentration and delay the onset of clinical and pathological changes of Cu toxicity in LEC rats. Although the actual mechanism of protection is unknown, it could be explained by sequestration of dietary Cu by intestinal MT, induced by high dietary Zn content.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
15773321,[Genetic disorders of copper transport--diagnosis and new treatment for the patients of Wilson's disease].,Tsugutoshi Aoki,"Wilson's disease and Menkes disease are inherited genetic disorders of copper metabolism. Each disease results from the absence or dysfunction of homologous copper-transporting ATPases present in the trans-Golgi network of cells. The Wilson ATPase transports copper into the hepatocyte secretory pathway for incorporation into ceruloplasmin and excretion into the bile. Thus, patients with Wilson's disease of the autosomal recessive trait present with signs and symptoms arising from impaired biliary copper excretion. The Menkes ATPase transports copper across the placenta, gastrointestinal tract, and blood-brain barrier, and the clinical features of this X-linked disease arise from copper deficiency. Despite striking differences in the clinical presentation of these two diseases, the respective ATPases function in precisely the same fashion within the cell. The different clinical features of each disease are the results of the tissue specific expression of these ATPases. In Wilson's disease, impaired biliary copper excretion leads to accumulation of this metal in the liver. When the capacity for hepatic storage is exceeded, cell death ensues, with copper release into the plasma resulting in hemolysis and deposition of copper in extrahepatic tissues. Affected patients usually present in the first or second decade of life with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis or acute liver failure. Copper accumulation in the cornea results in Kayser-Fleischer rings. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are more common in adults and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive impairment as a results of copper accumulation in the basal ganglia and other brain regions. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, and elevated hepatic copper concentration. A large number of different mutations occur in the genes of patients with Wilson disease. Copper chelation drugs and zinc are effective in most cases. New treatment guidelines now advise physicians to start patients on zinc.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The disorder is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, encoding a copper transporting P-type ATPase. The worldwide incidence is in the order of 30 cases per million, with a gene frequency of 0.56% and a carrier frequency of 1 in 90. The increased number of Wilson disease patients in the island of Crete led us to study the spectrum of mutations in a small village close to the city of Heraklion, from where many patients have been referred during the last 25 years. In order to estimate the frequency of the disease, we firstly investigated the number of births and the number of WD patients in the village since 1978. Six out of 90 births were diagnosed as WD patients, presenting the highest prevalence of WD reported so far. Analysis of the whole gene in three Wilson disease patients, and relatives of a boy who died from WD, led to the detection of 4 different point mutations. Two of them were missense (p.I1148T and p.G1176R) and cosegregated in cis in the same patient; the other allele of this patient carried a nonsense mutation (p.Q289X). This is the first report in the literature of three mutations co-segregating in the same WD patient. The fourth mutation identified was a novel frameshift mutation (c.398delT) with documented cosegregation. When screening 200 inhabitants originating from the same area, 18 were found to be carriers of one of these mutations. These findings indicate the need for health education intervention, genetic counselling and newborn screening for the Wilson disease.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Copper chelation decreases the secretion of many of these factors. Serum copper levels are upregulated in many human tumours and correlate with tumour burden and prognosis. Copper chelators reduce tumour growth and microvascular density in animal models. New orally active copper chelators have enabled clinical trials to be undertaken, and there are several studies ongoing.

16112185,"Copper, oxidative stress, and human health.","Janet Y Uriu-Adams, Carl L Keen","Copper (Cu), a redox active metal, is an essential nutrient for all species studied to date. During the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the concept that marginal deficits of this element can contribute to the development and progression of a number of disease states including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Deficits of this nutrient during pregnancy can result in gross structural malformations in the conceptus, and persistent neurological and immunological abnormalities in the offspring. Excessive amounts of Cu in the body can also pose a risk. Acute Cu toxicity can result in a number of pathologies, and in severe cases, death. Chronic Cu toxicity can result in liver disease and severe neurological defects. The concept that elevated ceruloplasmin is a risk factor for certain diseases is discussed. In this paper, we will review recent literature on the potential causes of Cu deficiency and Cu toxicity, and the pathological consequences associated with the above. Finally, we will review some of the potential biochemical lesions that might underlie these pathologies. Given that oxidative stress is a characteristic of Cu deficiency, the role of Cu in the oxidative defense system will receive special attention.

These cases included massive destruction of the white matter in superior gyri, mostly frontal, extending to the deep cortex with neuronal loss and capillary proliferation. Astrocytes were of Alzheimer type 1 and 2; and type 1 were labeled by anti-metallothionein. Opalski cells were abundant and their macrophagic lineage was confirmed by immunostaining. Among the possible mechanisms proposed, the role of vascular factors and penicillamine treatment could be excluded.

12946050,What have we learnt from CDNA microarray gene expression studies about the role of iron in MPTP induced neurodegeneration and Parkinson's disease?,M B H Youdim,"There have been numerous hypotheses concerning the etiology and mechanism of dorsal raphe dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease and its animal models, MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) and 6-hydroxydopamine. The advent of cDNA microarray gene expression where expression of thousands of genes can be globally assessed has indicated that mechanism of neurodegeneration by MPTP is a complex cascade of vicious circles. One of these is the alteration of genes associated with iron metabolism, a transitional metal closely associated with inducing the formation of reactive oxygen species and inducing oxidative stress. cDNA gene expression analyses support the established hypothesis of oxidative induced neurodegeneration involving iron deposition in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC) parkinsonian brains. The regulation of cellular iron metabolism has been further enhanced by the recent discovery of two iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2 which control the level of iron with in the cell. When the cellular level of iron increases IRP2 is degraded by ubiquitination and no further iron accumulates. The reverse occurs when the level of iron is low within the cell. Knock-out IRP1 and IRP2 mice have shown that in latter mice brain iron accumulation precedes the neurodegeneration, ataxia and bradykinesia observed in these animals. Indeed MPTP treatment, which results in iron accumulation in SNCP, abolishes IRP2 with the concomitant increase in alpha-synuclein. Iron chelators such as R-apomorphine and EGCG, which protect against MPTP neurotoxicity, prevent the loss of IRP2 and the increase in alpha-synuclein. The presence of iron together with alpha-synuclein in SNPC may be detrimental for dopaminergic neurons. Since, iron has been shown to cause aggregation of alpha-synuclein to a neurotoxic agent. The use of iron chelators penetrating the blood brain barrier as neuroprotective drugs has been envisaged.",2003,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Tetrathiomolybdate complexes copper to protein and itself, rendering the copper unavailable for cellular uptake. It was originally developed for Wilson's disease, and is now being developed as an antiangiogenic agent for the treatment of cancer. Many angiogenic cytokines require normal levels of copper, and lowered copper levels reduce cytokine signaling while cellular copper requirements are met. Cytokines of fibrosis and inflammation may be similarly copper dependent, since tetrathiomolybdate inhibits bleomycin induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. The basis for this inhibition was evaluated here by examination of tetrathiomolybdate effects on cytokines in lung pathophysiologically important in the bleomycin mouse model of pulmonary damage. Results in mice injected endotracheally with bleomycin confirmed that tetrathiomolybdate therapy was effective in reducing fibrosis. This effect was associated with significant inhibition of bleomycin-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor beta expression in lung homogenates. These effects were shown to be independent of one another. This indicates that tetrathiomolybdate therapy can be effective even when fibrosis is at a more chronic stage, wherein inflammatory cytokines are playing a diminishing role.

Several angiogenic cytokines appear to depend on normal levels of copper for activity. In both animal tumor models and in cancer patients, TM therapy has proved effective in inhibiting the growth of tumors. We have hypothesized that the activities of fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines are also subject to modulation by the availability of copper in a manner similar to angiogenic cytokines. As a first step in evaluating whether TM plays a therapeutic role in diseases of inflammation and fibrosis, we studied the effects of TM on a murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Oral TM therapy resulted in dose-dependent reduction in serum ceruloplasmin, a surrogate marker of systemic copper levels. Significant decreases in systemic copper levels were associated with marked reduction in lung fibrosis as determined on the basis of histopathologic findings and a biochemical measure of fibrosis.

In this study we report the results of molecular analyses of 20 WND families not described previously. When combined with our prior results, the cohort includes 93 index patients from 69 unrelated families. Twenty different mutations accounted for 86% of the WND chromosomes. The most frequent were p.H1069Q (35%), p.R969Q (12%), c.2530delA (7%), p.L936X (7%), p.Q289X (7%), and p.I1148T (3%). We also present here a detailed phenotypic assessment for patients whose molecular result was previously reported. Thirty cases were homozygous for 9 different mutations, 13 of which were homozygous for p.H1069Q, and 7 for p.R969Q. Mutations p.H1069Q and p.R969Q appeared to confer a milder disease as patients showed disease onset at a later age, and were associated with milder severity when found in trans with severe mutations. Predicted nonsense and frameshift mutations were associated with severe phenotypic expression with earlier disease onset and lower ceruloplasmin values. WND can be treated by copper-chelation therapy, particularly if the disease is diagnosed before irreversible tissue damage occurs.

Preoperative examinations (X-ray, CT and MRI) confirmed the diagnosis. The microscopic examination detected thickening of the synovial membrane, and histopathological findings revealed that lymphoid cells and plasma cells were infiltrated at the synovial membrane. On copper-specific staining, no copper pigmentation was identified. However, the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis revealed copper pigmentation in high concentration. These findings may contribute to our better comprehension of the development process of the arthropathy in patients with Wilson disease.

Using a 122-channel whole-head neuromagnetometer and surface electromyogram (EMG), we investigated cerebromuscular coupling. Postural tremor was observed in a sustained 45-degree posture of the right-sided forearm. Data were analyzed using dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS), revealing cerebromuscular coupling between EMG and cerebral activity. Coherent sources were superimposed on individual high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI). Phase lags between EMG and cerebral areas showing strongest coherence were determined by means of a Hilbert transform of both signals. In all patients, postural tremor was associated with strong coherence between tremor EMG and activity in contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) at tremor or double tremor frequency. Phase lag values between S1/M1 activity and EMG revealed efferent and afferent components in the corticomuscular coupling. Taken together, our results indicate that postural tremor in WD is mediated through a pathological oscillatory drive from the primary motor cortex.",2004,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

RLS occurs most commonly followed by CG. Currently, with the incidence of rheumatic fever lower than previously, any woman who develops CG should be checked for illness other than rheumatic heart disease. The differential includes systemic lupus erythromatosis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Regarding the use of dopaminergic agents, the dopamine agonist, pergolide, can be maintained during pregnancy for the treatment of PD, Segawa disease, and RLS. The use of levodopa and ropinirole should be limited during pregnancy because of the possible teratogenic effects. Amantadine is contraindicated during pregnancy. The data on selegiline are controversial; animal studies show possible serotonergic effects and teratogenic effects. If treatment is indicated in patients who have Tourette syndrome, the high potency neuroleptics drugs (haloperidol) are preferred to treat associated symptoms. Depression is a common comorbidity in patients who have PD, HD,Tourette syndrome, or other chronic neurologic diseases. Depression treatment during pregnancy is covered by Levy et al elsewhere in this issue. As discussed previously, most of the data on the use of drugs during pregnancy, especially the dopaminergic agents, are limited to animal studies and case reports.

When mild, chorea can be difficult to differentiate from restlessness. When chorea is proximal and of large amplitude, it is called ballism. Chorea is usually worsened by anxiety and stress and subsides during sleep. Most patients attempt to disguise chorea by incorporating it into a purposeful activity. Whereas ballism is most often encountered as hemiballism due to contralateral structural lesions of the subthalamic nucleus and/or its afferent or efferent projections, chorea may be the expression of a wide range of disorders, including metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, vascular, and neurodegenerative, as well as drug induced syndromes. In clinical practice, Sydenham's chorea is the most common form of childhood chorea, whereas Huntington's disease and drug induced chorea account for the majority of adult onset cases.

Thirty-seven cases were identified. The main indication for liver transplantation was chronic advanced liver disease in 78% of patients. Mixed hepatic and neuropsychiatric symptoms were recorded in 32.3%. Eight patients presented with fulminant liver failure; 44.8% were on medical treatment. Patient and graft survival at 3 months, 12 months, 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years after transplantation were, respectively, 91.8%, 89.1%, 82.9%, 75.6%, and 58.8%, and 85.3%, 83.0%, 77.1%, 70.3%, and 47.2%. Neurological symptoms significantly improved after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), but the survival of patients with mixed hepatic and neuropsychiatric involvement was significantly lower than in patients with liver disease alone (P = 0.04). WD characterized by hepatic involvement alone is a rare but good indication for liver transplantation when specific medical therapy fails. Patients with neuropsychiatric signs have a significantly shorter survival even though liver transplantation has a positive impact on neurological symptoms. In conclusion, a combination of hepatic and neuropsychiatric conditions deserves careful neurological evaluation, which should contraindicate OLT in case of severe neurological impairment.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
18789784,[The onset of psychiatric disorders and Wilson's disease].,"T Benhamla, Y D Tirouche, A Abaoub-Germain, F Theodore","Wilson's disease is an infrequent, autosomic recessive pathology, resulting from a loss of function of an adenosine triphosphatase (ATP7B or WDNP), secondarily to a change (more than 60 are described currently), insertion or deletion of the ATP7B gene located on the chromosome 13q14.3-q21.1, which involves a reduction or an absence of the transport of copper in the bile and its accumulation in the body, notably the brain. Wilson's disease is transmitted by an autosomic recessive gene located on the long arm of chromosome 13. The prevalence of the heterozygote is evaluated at 1/90 and the homozygote at 1/30,000. Consanguinity, frequent in the socially geographically isolated populations, increases the prevalence of the disease. The toxic quantities of copper, which accumulate in the liver since early childhood and perhaps before, remain concentrated in the body for years. Hence, cytological and histological modifications can be detected in the biopsies, before the appearance of clinical or biological symptoms of hepatic damage. The accumulation of copper in the liver is due to a defect in the biliary excretion of metal and is accompanied invariably by a deficit in ceruloplasmin; protein synthesized from a transferred ATP7B gene, which causes retention of the copper ions in the liver. The detectable cellular anomalies are of two types: hepatic lesions resulting in acute hepatic insufficiency, acute hepatitis and finally advanced cirrhosis and lesions of the central nervous system responsible for the neurological and psychiatric disorders. In approximately 40-50% of the patients, the first manifestation of Wilson's disease affects the central nervous system. Although copper diffuses in the liver towards the blood and then towards other tissues, it has disastrous consequences only in the brain. It can therefore cause either a progressive neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders. Wilson's disease begins in the form of a hepatic, neurological, or psychiatric disease in at least 90% of the patients. In some rare cases, the first manifestations of the disease can be psychiatric which, according to the literature, accounts for only 10% of the cases. The disease can be revealed by isolated behavioral problems, an irrational syndrome, a schizophrenic syndrome, or a manic-depressive syndrome. Damage to the central nervous system can be more severe, thus, several differential diagnoses have been discussed: a psychotic disorder of late appearance; a depressive state; a mental confusion disorder. The clinical syndrome is complex. Indeed, it is the polymorphism, which dominates in the description of the psychiatric demonstrations of the disease. This can lead to prejudicial diagnostic wandering, particularly since heavy sedative treatment may be required to suppress behavioral problems. Clinically, Wilson's disease generally appears between the age of 10 and 20. It rarely remains masked until after the age of 40. The first manifestations are hepatic (40% of the cases), neurological (35%) or psychiatric (10%). The inaugural disorder can finally take on a haematological, renal, or mixed form in approximately 15% of the cases. We have detailed the principal clinical elements. In approximately 40-50% of the patients, the first manifestation of the disease affects the central nervous system, where it can cause either a progressive neurological disease, or psychiatric disorders. The ophthalmologic disorder is dominated by Kayser-Fleischer's ring, representing a green or bronze colored ring on the periphery of the cornea. It occupies the higher pole of the cornea, then the lower pole, and extends to the whole circumference. It is generally only visible under examination with a slit lamp. It disappears on average within 3-5 years following copper chelating therapy. Kayser-Fleischer's ring has been described other than in Wilson's disease, in exceptional cases of prolonged cholestasis. On haematological level, the hyperhaemolysis is due to the toxicity of the ionic copper, released massively in the plasma by hepatocellular necrosis. The other manifestations can be found in the following organs: renal, osteoarticular, cardiac, endocrine, cutaneous, and in the teguments. Until 1952, the diagnosis was evoked only on clinical symptomatology. It can henceforth be marked unambiguous, even in the absence of any symptom, by the description of a ceruloplasmin plasma concentration of less than 200 ml/l, and of a Kayser-Fleischer's ring. Hepatic copper on sample is constantly increased during the disease (from 3 to 25 micromol/g of dry weight). On the other hand, the absence of a reduction in the plasma ceruloplasmin does not make it possible to exclude the diagnosis. Conversely, a reduction in ceruloplasmin can exist other than in Wilson's disease (nephritic syndrome, malabsorption syndrome, or severe hepatic insufficiency). Kayser-Fleischer's ring is quasiconstant among patients with neuropsychiatric demonstrations (thus, its absence represents a very strong argument against the diagnosis). It can on the other hand be lacking during hepatic forms, and in this case, its absence is not an argument against the diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging can reveal abnormal signals of the grey cores. A genetic study is conducted by liaison analysis in the event of a family history of the disease. When it is not treated, Wilson's disease induces lesions of the tissues, the outcome of which is always fatal. Treatment relies on the regulation of copper chelation, which improves the prognosis, and zinc, which captures the copper in a nontoxic form. The severe psychiatric disorders observed during Wilson's disease may require tranquilizers, but care should be taken because of potential neurological or hepatic side effects. Lithium seems an interesting treatment and remains theoretically indicated, taking into account the scarcity of the extrapyramidal symptoms and the hepatic dysfunction among patients at the stage of cirrhosis, since it is not metabolized in the liver. Although rare, it is important to approach Wilson's disease in psychiatry because the psychiatric manifestations can precede the somatic disorders and help to pose the diagnosis. We stress the importance of the early diagnosis of the pathology, the outcome of which is fatal in the absence of specific treatment.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

To the most frequent symptoms of this disorder belong liver, neurological or psychiatric disturbances, although other less common clinical features may sometimes be present.

16998287,[Wilson disease: an update].,Jeong Kee Seo,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper transport that results in accumulation of copper primarily in the liver, the brain and the cornea. WD is the most common inherited liver disease with the prevalence of 1: 37,000 in the pediatric population in Korea. Mutations in the ATP7B gene cause failure of copper excretion into the bile and a defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. More than 300 mutations in the ATP7B gene have been described so far. Mutations differ between ethnic groups. The p.R778L (an allele frequency of 37%), p.A874V (13%), p.L1083F (8%) and p.N1270S (6%) are the common major mutations in Korea. Conflicting results on genotype/phenotype correlations of the most common mutations have been reported in various countries. There seems to be no correlation between the R778L mutation and age of onset or clinical manifestations in Korean patients. None of the laboratory parameters alone allows a definite diagnosis of WD. In a nation-wide survey of WD, low serum ceruloplasmin (<20 mg/dL), high 24 hour urine copper (>100 microgram), high hepatic copper content (>250 microgram/g of dry liver) and Kayser-Fleischer rings were found in 96%, 86%, 88%, and 73% of the 550 Korean patients respectively. A combination of any two of the above 4 laboratory findings is strong support for a diagnosis of WD. For the last couple of years, genetic testing has been playing an increasingly important role in diagnosing WD. Direct DNA sequencing did confirm WD in 98% of the Korean patients. Two mutations were detected in 70% and one mutation in 28% of the patients who showed characteristic biochemical and clinical findings of WD. Genetic testing, either by haplotype analysis or by mutation analysis, is the only reliable tool for differentiating heterozygote carriers from affected asymptomatic patients. The agents of the first choice among chelators and zinc in specific clinical situations of WD is still a matter of debate. Because of frequent side effects and initial neurologic deterioration of penicillamine therapy, less toxic trientine or zinc has gradually replaced penicillamine over the past few years. Trientine or tetrathiomolybdate has been increasingly recommended as the first-line treatment for neurologic WD. Currently, liver transplantation is not recommended as primary treatment for neurologic WD. Recently published data show that initial zinc therapy for asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients and maintenance zinc therapy in patients after long term chelation are safe and effective.

16763894,B6-responsive disorders: a model of vitamin dependency.,Peter T Clayton,"Pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor for over 100 enzyme-catalysed reactions in the body, including many involved in the synthesis or catabolism of neurotransmitters. Inadequate levels of pyridoxal phosphate in the brain cause neurological dysfunction, particularly epilepsy. There are several different mechanisms that lead to an increased requirement for pyridoxine and/or pyridoxal phosphate. These include: (i) inborn errors affecting the pathways of B(6) vitamer metabolism; (ii) inborn errors that lead to accumulation of small molecules that react with pyridoxal phosphate and inactivate it; (iii) drugs that react with pyridoxal phosphate; (iv) coeliac disease, which is thought to lead to malabsorption of B(6) vitamers; (v) renal dialysis, which leads to increased losses of B(6) vitamers from the circulation; (vi) drugs that affect the metabolism of B(6) vitamers; and (vii) inborn errors affecting specific pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes. The last show a very variable degree of pyridoxine responsiveness, from 90% in X-linked sideroblastic anaemia (delta-aminolevulinate synthase deficiency) through 50% in homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency) to 5% in ornithinaemia with gyrate atrophy (ornithine delta-aminotransferase deficiency). The possible role of pyridoxal phosphate as a chaperone during folding of nascent enzymes is discussed. High-dose pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate may have deleterious side-effects (particularly peripheral neuropathy with pyridoxine) and this must be considered in treatment regimes. None the less, in some patients, particularly infants with intractable epilepsy, treatment with pyridoxine or pyridoxal phosphate can be life-saving, and in other infants with inborn errors of metabolism B(6) treatment can be extremely beneficial.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

On this basis and based on estimates of bioavailability of zinc, dietary recommendations are made for apparently healthy individuals. Absent chemical, functional, and/or physical signs of zinc deficiency are assumed indicative of adequacy. More specific data are seldom available. Changing food preferences and availability, and new food preparation, preservation, and processing technologies may require re-evaluation of past data. Conservative estimates suggest that 25% of the world's population is at risk of zinc deficiency. Most of the affected are poor, and rarely consume foods rich in highly bioavailable zinc, while subsisting on foods that are rich in inhibitors of zinc absorption and/or contain relatively small amounts of bioavailable zinc. In contrast, among the relatively affluent, food choice is a major factor affecting risk of zinc deficiency. An additional problem, especially among the relatively affluent, is risk of chronic zinc toxicity caused by excessive consumption of zinc supplements. High intakes of zinc relative to copper can cause copper deficiency. A major challenge that has not been resolved for maximum health benefit is the proximity of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and the reference dose (RfD) for safe intake of zinc. Present recommendations do not consider the numerous dietary factors that influence the bioavailability of zinc and copper, and the likelihood of toxicity from zinc supplements. Thus the current assumed range between safe and unsafe intakes of zinc is relatively narrow. At present, assessment of zinc nutriture is complex, involving a number of chemical and functional measurements that have limitations in sensitivity and specificity. This approach needs to be enhanced so that zinc deficiency or excess can be detected early. An increasing number of associations between diseases and zinc status and apparently normal states of health, where additional zinc might be efficacious to prevent certain conditions, point at the pharmacology of zinc compounds as a promising area. For example, relationships between zinc and diabetes mellitus are an area where research might prove fruitful. In our opinion, a multidisciplinary approach will most likely result in success in this fertile area for translational research.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Here we assessed the effect of copper accumulation in the tx mouse on zinc and iron metabolism. Copper, zinc and iron concentrations were determined in the liver, kidney, spleen and brain of control and copper-loaded animals by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Copper concentration increased dramatically in the liver, and was also significantly higher in the spleen, kidney and brain of control tx mice in the first few months of life compared with normal DL mice. Hepatic zinc was increased with age in the tx mouse, but zinc concentrations in the other organs were normal. Liver and kidney iron concentrations were significantly lower at birth in tx mice, but increased quickly to be comparable with control mice by 2 months of age. Iron concentration in the spleen was significantly higher in tx mice, but was lower in 5 day old tx pups. Copper-loading studies showed that normal DL mice ingesting 300 mg/l copper in their diet for 3 months maintained normal liver, kidney and brain copper, zinc and iron levels. Copper-loading of tx mice did not increase the already high liver copper concentrations, but spleen and brain copper concentrations were increased. Despite a significant elevation of copper in the brain of the copper-loaded tx mice no behavioural changes were observed. The livers of copper-loaded tx mice had a lower zinc concentration than control tx mice, whilst the kidney had double the concentration of iron suggesting that there was increased erythrocyte hemolysis in the copper-loaded mutants.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Oxidative stress can be defined as the imbalance between cellular oxidant species production and antioxidant capability shifted towards the former. Lipid peroxidation is one of the processes that takes place during oxidative stress. Lipid peroxidation products, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), are closely related to carcinogenesis as they are potent mutagens and they have been suggested as modulators of signal pathways related to proliferation and apoptosis, two processes implicated in cancer development. Mechanisms by which oxidative stress leads to tumor formation are still under investigation. The need of suitable in vivo models that could reflect that inflammation-related human carcinogenesis is evident. In this regard, the mutant strain Long Evans Cinnamon-like (LEC) rat provides a promising model for investigation of the relationship between hepatitis induced by oxidative stress and hepatocarcinogenesis because it has been demonstrated to develop spontaneous liver tumor formation related to copper accumulation and oxidative stress. In this review, the findings regarding oxidative stress and its relation with liver pathologies in LEC rats are discussed; we focus on the mechanisms proposed for HNE carcinogenesis.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Here, we show that Cu(2+) triggers hepatocyte apoptosis through activation of acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) and release of ceramide. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of Asm prevented Cu(2+)-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and protected rats, genetically prone to develop Wilson disease, from acute hepatocyte death, liver failure and early death. Cu(2+) induced the secretion of activated Asm from leukocytes, leading to ceramide release in and phosphatidylserine exposure on erythrocytes, events also prevented by inhibition of Asm. Phosphatidylserine exposure resulted in immediate clearance of affected erythrocytes from the blood in mice. Accordingly, individuals with Wilson disease showed elevated plasma levels of Asm, and displayed a constitutive increase of ceramide- and phosphatidylserine-positive erythrocytes.

Decompensated chronic WD usually responds to chelation therapy. Our aim was to validate 3 published scoring systems for deciding between chelation treatment and liver transplantation in patients with chronic decompensated and fulminant WD. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, as well as WD prognostic index (WPI) and its recently revised version (RWPI) were evaluated as predictors of the safety for chelation therapy. A group of 14 adult patients with decompensated chronic WD who improved on penicillamine treatment were compared with 21 patients with fulminant WD. The diagnosis of WD was based on increased urinary copper excretion and confirmed by elevated liver copper content and/or mutation analysis of the WD gene. The MELD score, WPI, and RWPI were calculated for all patients with WD. The accuracy of the MELD score, WPI, and RWPI for prediction of response to chelation therapy in patients with decompensated chronic WD was 0.968, 0.980, and 0.993, respectively. None of the decompensated chronic WD patients had a MELD score >30, RWPI >11, or WPI >7. RWPI showed the highest accuracy and the lowest false negativity compared with WPI and MELD.

Major congenital anomalies of the patients were very different. Patient 1 suffered from severe congenital heart disease, but did not show apparent HSCR. Patient 2 suffered from typical HSCR and underwent surgical treatment, but did not have congenital heart disease. According to the gene analysis using white blood cells, they had nonsense mutations in ZFHX1B, R695X and Q433X, respectively.

17382611,"Wilson disease--a practical approach to diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.","V Medici, L Rossaro, G C Sturniolo","Wilson disease is an inherited, autosomal recessive, copper accumulation and toxicity disorder that affects about 30 individuals per million. This rare disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, which is important for copper excretion into bile, leading to copper accumulation in the liver. Toxic copper concentrations can also be found in the brain and kidney, and clinical phenotypes include hepatic, haemolytic, neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical features and findings such as increased urinary copper excretion, reduced levels of serum ceruloplasmin, high concentrations of copper in liver tissues and Kayser-Fleischer rings. Genetic studies are also becoming available for clinical use, but the utility of direct mutation analysis is limited. Wilson disease can be treated, and early diagnosis is essential: the goal of therapy is to reduce copper accumulation either by enhancing its urinary excretion or by decreasing its intestinal absorption. Medical therapies include penicillamine, trientine, zinc and tetrathiomolibdate. Liver transplantation is a relatively successful treatment option when medical therapy fails or in case of acute liver failure, even though it is also characterized by short- and long-term complications.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Cu is also an essential element in mammalian nutrition. Since both copper deficiency and copper excess produce adverse health effects, the dose-response curve is U-shaped, although the precise form has not yet been well characterized. Many animal and human studies were conducted on copper to provide a rich database from which data suitable for modeling the dose-response relationship for copper may be extracted. Possible dose-response modeling strategies are considered in this review, including those based on the benchmark dose and categorical regression. The usefulness of biologically based dose-response modeling techniques in understanding copper toxicity was difficult to assess at this time since the mechanisms underlying copper-induced toxicity have yet to be fully elucidated. A dose-response modeling strategy for copper toxicity was proposed associated with both deficiency and excess. This modeling strategy was applied to multiple studies of copper-induced toxicity, standardized with respect to severity of adverse health outcomes and selected on the basis of criteria reflecting the quality and relevance of individual studies. The use of a comprehensive database on copper-induced toxicity is essential for dose-response modeling since there is insufficient information in any single study to adequately characterize copper dose-response relationships. The dose-response modeling strategy envisioned here is designed to determine whether the existing toxicity data for copper excess or deficiency may be effectively utilized in defining the limits of the homeostatic range in humans and other species. By considering alternative techniques for determining a point of departure and low-dose extrapolation (including categorical regression, the benchmark dose, and identification of observed no-effect levels) this strategy will identify which techniques are most suitable for this purpose. This analysis also serves to identify areas in which additional data are needed to better define the characteristics of dose-response relationships for copper-induced toxicity in relation to excess or deficiency.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

As copper accumulation in the brain leads to disturbances in basal ganglia function, neurological-type patients typically present with hypo- and hyperkinetic extrapyramidal symptoms, with Parkinsonism being very common. Although there are numerous reports on olfactory deficits in primary neurodegenerative disorders, olfactory function has not been investigated in metabolic disorders presenting with extrapyramidal features. Twenty-four patients with Wilson's disease participated in the investigation. All patients were treated pharmacologically. They comprised patients with liver disease alone (including mild enzyme elevation in asymptomatic individuals; n = 11) and/or neurological symptoms (n = 13) at the time of testing. Twenty-one patients underwent both [18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was judged using a clinical score system ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). In all patients, psychophysical testing was performed using the Sniffin' Sticks, which involved tests for odor threshold, discrimination, and identification. Results from the present study revealed that Wilson's disease patients with neurological symptoms show a significant olfactory dysfunction compared to hepatic-type patients. Individuals who are more severely neurologically affected also present with a more pronounced olfactory deficit. Of interest, there was no significant effect of long-term treatment with penicillamine on olfactory function. Olfactory function did not correlate significantly with the presence of MRI visible lesions in the basal ganglia or with any regional glucose metabolism as measured by [18]F-FDG-PET. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the underlying pathological alterations with degeneration in the basal ganglia and neuronal loss in association with a marked increase of the copper content in this brain region play a role in the olfactory deficit.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The investigation was conducted on 20 newborn rats bred from 40 female and six male rats. DPA doses 400 mg kg(-1) day(-1) and physiological saline were given intraperitoneally (i.p) to experimental and control groups. To assess newborn maturation, their body and lung weights were determined. Serum Cu levels were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy and ceruloplasmin (Cp) activities were measured spectrophotometrically. Newborn lung tissue elastin, desmosine (DES) and isodesmosine (IDES) levels were measured by HPLC. The results showed that DPA treatment caused loss of skin elasticity and reduction in body and lung weight in newborns of the experimental group. The serum Cu levels and Cp activity were found to be significantly lower in both maternal and newborn of the experimental groups compared with the control group. The lung DES, IDES and elastin values of newborns in the experimental group were decreased compared with the control group. In conclusion, our results indicate that 400 mg kg(-1) day(-1) DPA, a dose that is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and cystinuria, caused the retardation of newborn maturation, a decrease in DES-IDES cross-links and levels of lung elastin of offspring in the perinatal period. Another conclusion to be drawn from this study is that even low levels of Cu depletion due to DPA administration induces a change in cross-linking in lung elastin during the perinatal period.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Prognostic criteria described by our group in 1986 to predict death without transplantation have not been universally validated. The clinical features of 88 children were reviewed, retrospectively in 74 and prospectively in 14. Data from the retrospectively recruited patients that died or survived on long-term chelation were used to evaluate the validity of our old scoring system and to devise a new prognostic index, then assessed in the 14 prospectively recruited patients. Using the old scoring system, 5 children scoring > or = 7, the cutoff value for death without transplantation, survived, whereas 4 scoring < or = 7 died (sensitivity 87% and specificity 90%). A new index based on serum bilirubin, international normalized ratio, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and white cell count (WCC) at presentation identified a cutoff score of 11 for death and proved to be 93% sensitive and 98% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. When the new index was evaluated prospectively in 14 patients, it predicted the need for transplantation in only the 4 who required it, although 1 child with a score of 11 survived on medical treatment.

Trials in human patients are underway. If the efficacy of TM is indeed through lowering copper levels, other anticopper drugs should be equally efficacious. Zinc is an anticopper drug, with proven efficacy in Wilson's disease, a disease of copper toxicity. In this study, the efficacy of zinc is compared with TM on a mouse tumor model and on the doxorubicin model of heart damage, and it is hypothesized that when copper availability is lowered to an equivalent extent, the 2 drugs would show equivalent efficacy. No effect is found of zinc on inhibiting growth of a tumor that is markedly inhibited by TM, and zinc is found to be less effective than TM in inhibiting cardiac damage from doxorubicin. This study shows that TM's mechanism of action in protecting against doxorubicin toxicity is because of its anticopper effects, as copper supplementation eliminated the protective effect of TM. It is also hypothesized that the differences between TM and zinc may be caused by TM's mechanism of action in which it binds copper already in the body, whereas zinc does not.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Because effective treatment is available, recognizing this disease in presymptomatic or early stages, when it can be reversed, is highly important. Diagnosis is often easy but the available tests (measurement of ceruloplasmin, and blood, urinary and liver copper levels) can be misleading.

The clinical manifestations are heterogeneous as well in their presentation, dominated by the neuropsychiatric and hepatic symptoms, as in the age of the first symptoms. Early recognition and initiation of therapy with chelators or zinc are essential for prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated in cases with fulminant hepatitis, end-stage liver cirrhosis and should be considered in the therapy resistant neurological forms.

Besides, in the region of the striatum and the nucleus accumbens of the LEC rats, lower content of norepinephrine, and higher content of dopamine and serotonin were observed compared with Wistar rats. Although copper supplementation did not affect the brain copper content, it reduced the PPI in both Wistar and LEC rats.

The Wilson's disease gene is localized on human chromosome 13 and codes for ATP7B, a copper transporting P-type ATPase. A genetic defect similar to that of Wilson's disease occurs in Long Evans Cinnamon rats and toxic milk mice. Familial copper storage disorders in Bedlington and West Highland white terriers are associated with early subclinical disease, and copper accumulation with subsequent liver injury culminating in cirrhosis. The canine copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers has been mapped to canine chromosome region CFA 10q26. Recently, a mutated MURR1 gene was discovered in Bedlington terriers affected with the disease. Idiopathic childhood cirrhosis is biochemically similar to copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers, but clinically much more severe. Both conditions are characterized by the absence of neurologic damage and Kayser-Fleisher rings, and normal ceruloplasmin levels. A recent study added North Ronaldsay sheep to the list of promising animal models to study Indian childhood cirrhosis. Morphologic similarities between the two conditions include periportal to panlobular copper retention and liver changes varying from active hepatitis to panlobular pericellular fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Certain copper-associated disorders, such as chronic active hepatitis in Doberman pinschers and Skye terrier hepatitis are characterized by copper retention secondary to the underlying disease, thus resembling primary biliary cirrhosis in humans. Copper-associated liver disease has increasingly being recognized in Dalmatians. Copper-associated liver diseases in Dalmatians and Long Evans Cinnamom rats share many morphologic features. Fulminant hepatic failure in Dalmatians is characterized by high serum activities of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and severe necrosis of centrilobular areas (periacinar, zone 3) hepatocytes. Macrophages and surviving hepatocytes contain copper-positive material. Liver disease associated with periacinar copper accumulation has also been described in Siamese cats. Many questions regarding copper metabolism in mammals, genetic background, pathogenesis and treatment of copper-associated liver diseases remain to be answered.

10378366,[Therapy of Wilson disease].,"C Smolarek, W Stremmel","Wilson disease is a copper storage disease with autosomal-recessive trait that is predominantly a disorder of the adolescent and young adult. Clinical manifestations are dominated by hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Diagnostic procedures include determination of total serum copper, free serum copper and serum ceruloplamin concentrations as well as urinary copper excretion. Confirmation of diagnosis may be achieved by liver biopsy and histological determination of copper content. The aim of treatment is reduction of tissue copper concentration and detoxification of copper. Drugs applied are the chelating agents. D-penicillamine and trientine, or zinc. The chelating agents induce renal and biliary copper excretion and increased synthesis of metallothionein, which attaches and detoxifies intracellular copper, leading to impaired absorption and binding of excess intracellular copper. Treatment with zinc results in induction of hepatic and intestinal metallothionein synthesis. Regular examinations of the parameters of copper metabolism are necessary in order to control the therapeutic effect. Free copper serum concentrations and urinary copper excretion should reach values below 10 micrograms/dl and 80 micrograms/day, respectively. A significant improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of parameters of copper metabolism can be expected earliest six months after onset of therapy. Anti-copper treatment may be accompanied by copper-reduced diet. Lifelong therapy is required and provides life-expectancy near to normal. Interruption of treatment leads to reaccumulation of copper, often resulting in fulminant hepatic failure. This can also be observed as initial presentation in 5% of cases (predominant age 12 to 25 years). End stage liver disease and fulminant hepatic failure are indications for liver transplantation by which the genetic defect is phenotypically cured. Here decoppering treatment is no longer required.

Envisaged findings with regard to the diagnosis of the investigated patients and their treatment: elevated plasma zinc concentration and increased urinary excretion, reduced copper and ceruloplasmin plasma concentration and increased urinary copper excretion. The authors recorded also a significantly elevated selenium plasma concentration and a significantly higher concentration of superoxide dismutase in red blood cells (p < 0.05). The increase of the glutathione peroxidase activity in whole blood in the investigated patients was not significant (p < 0.05). Changes in the values of the investigated parameters in patients with Wilson s disease treated on a long-term basis with zinc indicate the possible mutual interaction of zinc with other trace elements with an impact on the activity of the corresponding metalloenzymes, i.e. in the sphere in antioxidant systems.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In 1997, zinc acetate was added to the list of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which includes penicillamine and trientine. The mechanism of zinc's anticopper action is unique. It induces intestinal cell metallothionein, which binds copper and prevents its transfer into blood. As intestinal cells die and slough, the contained copper is eliminated in the stool. Thus, zinc prevents the intestinal absorption of copper. It is universally agreed that pregnant Wilson's disease patients should remain on anticopper therapy during pregnancy. There are numerous reports of such patients stopping penicillamine therapy to protect their fetus from teratogenicity, only to undergo serious deterioration and even death from renewed copper toxicity. Penicillamine and trientine have teratogenic effects in animals, and penicillamine has known teratogenic effects in humans. In this report we discuss the results of 26 pregnancies in 19 women who were on zinc therapy throughout their pregnancy.

Accumulated copper causes tissue damage. The chelating drugs penicillamine and trientine have been the mainstay of therapy and most patients with WD were treated with the potentially toxic cupriuretic agents. A more recent approach has used zinc, which blocks the absorption of copper and increases copper excretion in the stool, and long term administration induces a negative copper balance. Until recently, most patients have been treated initially with cupriuretic agents to remove excess of copper, and then maintained with oral zinc. Recently, zinc has been used for initial treatment as well and for treatment of the presymptomatic patients. So far, zinc therapy has demonstrated exceptional efficacy and lack of toxicity. In this article we present our data on the long-term follow-up of three children with WD, whose initial as well as consecutive treatment was zinc sulphate. The results demonstrate the efficacy of zinc therapy in treating the presymptomatic patient and in initial treatment of symptomatic children with WD. Our data also indicate low toxicity.

By direct sequencing, we identified five mutations, of which two were novel, and 16 polymorphisms, of which 6 were novel. The mutations 2871delC and 2513delA shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is expected. In contrast to these mutations found in patients with hepatic-type of early onset, the mutations A874V, R778L, and 3892delGTC were either missense mutations or in frame 1-amino acid deletion, and occurred in the patients with hepato-neurologic type of late onset. The mutations 2871delC and R778L have been previously reported in a relatively large number of Japanese patients. In particular, R778L is known to be more prevalent in Asian countries than in other countries of the world.

Among hereditary diseases due to a defect in the metabolism of Cu, Menkes disease (caused by a Cu deficiency) and Wilson disease (caused by the excessive accumulation of Cu) have been shown to be caused by the mutation of genes encoding Cu-binding ATPase for the efflux of Cu, ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively. Following the identification of these causative genes, intracellular Cu transporters (Cu chaperones) specific for the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and Cu, Zn-SOD were discovered, and these findings have facilitated the study of the underlying mechanisms of the biological regulation of Cu. Apart from these physiological and biochemical studies, toxicological studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms of the occurrence of acute hepatitis caused by the accumulation of Cu accumulating in the liver of an animal model for Wilson disease, LEC rats. In these toxicological studies, two biological aspects of metallothionein (MT), i.e., antioxidant and prooxidant depending on the Cu/Zn ratio in Cu-containing MT have been proposed. The present article overviews the recent findings on the biological regulation of Cu and on the toxicological aspect of Cu. It is known that Cu forms a stable ternary complex with molybdenum and sulfur under reductive conditions in the body. On the basis of this observation, tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) has been applied to remove Cu from the liver of Long-Evans rats with a cinnamon-like coat color (LEC) rats.

The possible interaction of Cu(2+) with the Zn(2+) binding site on the GABA(A) receptor complex was studied in acutely isolated Purkinje cells using whole-cell recording and a fast drug application system. When Zn(2+) was applied together with 2 microM GABA, the Zn(2+)-induced block of GABA-mediated currents was not additive to the Cu(2+)-induced block. In the presence of 0.1 microM Cu(2+) in the bath solution the degree of inhibition of GABA-mediated responses by Zn(2+) was strongly attenuated. Preapplication of 100 microM Zn(2+) during 10 s, terminated 1 s before exposure to 2 microM GABA did not affect the GABA current in Cu(2+)-free solution, but relieved its block by 0.1 microM Cu(2+). This effect of Zn(2+) was concentration-dependent with an EC(50) of 72 microM. When the Cu(2+)-induced block was removed by histidine, preapplication of Zn(2+) did not increase the GABA current, indicating that the relief of Cu(2+) block by Zn(2+) is the result of its ability to actively remove Cu(2+) from the GABA receptor complex. It is proposed that the inhibitory effects of Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) on GABA-induced currents result from an action of these metal ions at distinct, but conformationally linked sites on the GABA(A) receptor protein. Under physiological conditions Zn(2+) would liberate Cu(2+) from the GABA(A) receptor, thus facilitating Cu(2+) turnover and its binding by other endogenous chelating molecules.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

However, the insoluble Cu/TTM complex formed with excess TTM is known to be deposited in the liver. The metabolic fate of the insoluble Cu/TTM complex was investigated in the present study. LEC rats were injected with TTM at the dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days and were fed with a standard or low Cu diet for 14 days after the last injection. About 95% of the Cu in the liver became insoluble together with Mo. The concentration of Cu in the liver supernatants of rats fed with the standard diet increased significantly compared with that in rats dissected 24 h after the last injection (control rats), while the concentration in rats fed with the low Cu diet remained at a comparable level to that in the controls. The rate of Cu accumulation in the livers of rats fed with the standard diet did not differ before and after the treatment, suggesting that there was no rebound effect by treatment with TTM. These results suggest that the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is resolubilized in the liver, and that the solubilized complex is excreted into the bile and blood, i.e., the insoluble Cu/TTM complex is not the source of Cu re-accumulation in the form bound to MT in the liver after TTM treatment. It was concluded that, once Cu is complexed with TTM, the metal is excreted either immediately in the soluble form or slowly in the insoluble form into the bile and blood.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In the present study, we investigated the ability of excess dietary histidine to reduce the excess accumulation of liver Cu in LEC rats by comparing them with Fischer rats. The results clearly showed that the excess-histidine diet markedly stimulated the Cu excretion in urine, and significantly decreased the liver Cu content in LEC rats by 47.5%. The serum Cu content in LEC rats was not influenced by excess dietary histidine. We also compared the effects of excess dietary histidine on some liver antioxidant enzyme activities, liver and serum lipid levels and serum alanine aminotransferase activity of LEC and Fischer rats. Dietary histidine decreased the activities of total and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase in the liver of both strains. In LEC rats, the liver cholesterol content decreased, and serum cholesterol and phospholipids levels increased on feeding the excess-histidine diet. When fed on the basal diet, the serum alanine aminotransferase activity was higher in LEC rats than in Fischer rats, but a significant decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase activity of LEC rats was observed on feeding the excess-histidine diet. These results suggest that excess dietary histidine is effective in removing Cu ions from the liver of LEC rats.

This is dramatically illustrated by the genetic disorders X-linked Menkes disease and autosomal recessive Wilson's disease. In 1993, both the Menkes and Wilson's genes were isolated and it was found that these genes encode homologous cation copper transporting P-type ATPase proteins. The Menkes protein (ATP7A) is expressed in most tissues, except liver. In contrast, the Wilson's protein (ATP7B) is abundantly expressed in liver. Intracellular localization of those proteins was investigated. Both ATP7A and ATP7B are localized in the trans-Golgi network and post-Golgi vesicular compartment (PGVC) in the cell.

Furthermore, many toxic myopathies are characterized by nonspecific clinical and laboratory findings, ultimately requiring a trial of drug discontinuation in order to clarify the diagnosis. This review summarizes recent observations with regard to toxic effects on neuromuscular transmission and toxic myopathies.",1998,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

9881519,A critical evaluation of copper metabolism in Indian Wilson's disease children with special reference to their phenotypes and relatives.,"R Prasad, G Kaur, B N Walia","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper accumulation in various organs, with most common clinical manifestations such as hepatic, neurological, and renal dysfunctions. Serum copper and ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease were significantly lower as compared to normals, controls, and relatives of Wilson's disease patients, whereas marked hypercupriuria (145+/-7 microg/24 h) was observed in Wilson's children only. A good correlation (r=0.92) was found between non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper and 24-h urinary copper excretion in Wilson's disease patients. Further, copper studies among the different phenotypes of Wilson's disease revealed substantially low serum ceruloplasmin and a marked hypercupriuria in Wilson's disease children associated with renal tubular acidosis as compared to the patients with either hepatological or neurological manifestations. Serum ceruloplasmin levels in 14 patients of Wilson's disease were between 14 and 20 mg/dL. These patients of Wilson's disease were confirmed by measuring liver biopsy copper, which was about nine times higher than normal hepatic copper content. During the family screening by copper studies, four asymptomatic siblings were diagnosed for Wilson's disease.

9661287,Targeting of tetrathiomolybdate on the copper accumulating in the liver of LEC rats.,"Y Ogra, K T Suzuki","The uptake of tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) by the liver and the removal of copper (Cu) accumulating in the liver in a form bound to metallothionein (MT) by TTM were studied in Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats, an animal model of Wilson disease, in order to develop better treatments for the disease and Cu toxicity. Although molybdenum (Mo) was incorporated in a dose-dependent manner into the livers of both LEC and Long-Evans agouti (LEA) rats, the original strain of LEC rats used as a reference animal, the uptake into the liver of LEC rats was 13 times higher than that in LEA rats. The concentration of Mo in the soluble fraction plateaued and it was distributed more in the insoluble fraction with a higher dose in LEC rats. The concentration of Cu in the whole livers of LEC rats was decreased by TTM in a dose-dependent manner only at lower doses. However, the concentration of Cu in the soluble fraction continued to decrease with the dose of TTM. The results can be explained in terms of complex formation. Namely, TTM forms a complex with Cu, tentatively referred to a Cu/TTM complex, that can be effluxed into the bloodstream, and then binds selectively to albumin when the dose of TTM is low. On the other hand, TTM forms an insoluble complex, named as a Cu/TTM polymer that is precipitated in the liver when the dose is high. The results further indicate that TTM taken up by a cell is immobilized in the cell through the dose-dependent formation of a complex containing Cu, Mo and sulfur (S), which causes further uptake of TTM. TTM injected into rats or incubated in vitro with serum does not remove Cu from ceruloplasmin. TTM is, thus, suggested to target a cell accumulating excess Cu as Cu-MT, and to remove Cu selectively without interacting with Cu in Cu-enzymes. The results indicate that TTM is taken up by the liver depending on the amount of Cu accumulating in the form of MT, and then Cu is effluxed together with Mo in the form of Cu/TTM complex into the bloodstream.",1998,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In a first experiment, three groups of adult male Sprague Dawley rats were given by gavage one of the following treatments for 5 days: 0.5 mmol/kg/day of DPA, 0.046 mmol/kg/day of zinc acetate dihydrate, and 0.5 mmol/kg/day of DPA plus 0.046 mmol/kg/day of zinc acetate dihydrate. A fourth group of rats (control group) received deionized water during the same period. An increase in the urinary excretion of copper was observed following DPA treatment, which continued for at least 5 days after the administration of this compound was stopped. The amount of copper present in the feces, including that in the diet, was approximately 60 times greater than that normally present in control urines. During the period of zinc acetate administration, the amount of copper in the feces was slightly, but significantly greater than that during control, D-penicillamine, or D-penicillamine plus zinc acetate administration. No differences between the treated groups and the control group were found in brain, liver, kidney and spleen concentrations of rats 5 days after the end of the treatment period. In a second experiment, a similar comparison between D-penicillamine and sodium bis(3-mercapto-D-valinato)zinc hexahydrate (Na2[Zn(DPA)2] x 6H2O), both given by gavage, also showed no significant differences in the urinary excretion of copper in rats.",1998,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Two males receiving 1200 mg/kg/day died during week 8 of treatment. In males receiving 1200 mg/kg/day during weeks 5 to 8 of treatment, body weight gain and food consumption were decreased and hunched posture and thin build were observed. During week 4 or 8 of treatment urinalysis revealed, for males receiving 100 mg/kg/day or animals receiving 350 mg/kg/day or more, increased electrolyte outputs possibly due to the hydrochloride nature of trientine-2HCl, with low plasma alkaline phosphatase activities evident in animals receiving 350 or 1200 mg/kg/day. After 4 and 8 weeks, and during 8 weeks of treatment, high lung weights and bronchiolar epithelium hypertrophy and broncho-alveolar pneumonia were recorded for animals receiving 1200 mg/kg/day, and submucosal acute inflammation within the glandular region of the stomach was recorded for males receiving 350 or 1200 mg/kg/day and in all treated female groups. 26-week study. One male receiving 175 mg/kg/day and three males receiving 600 mg/kg/day died, showing lung changes. The body weight gain of animals receiving 600 mg/kg/day was slightly decreased. Blood chemistry and urinalysis examinations showed changes similar to those indicated in the 4- or 8-week study. The low plasma copper concentrations seen in males receiving 600 mg/kg/day, the slightly low liver copper concentrations found in animals receiving 600 or 175 mg/kg/day and the high urinary copper concentrations found in all treated groups, are attributed to the pharmacological action of trientine-2HCl. Histopathology revealed a dosage-related incidence and severity of focal chronic interstitial pneumonitis accompanied by fibrosis of the alveolar walls in females receiving 175 mg/kg/day or more and all treated male groups, but no significant pathological changes in the stomach. Apart from the histological changes found in the lung, all the above changes were reversible.

However, the long-term effects have not been fully evaluated and some evidence questions the long-term safety of the drug. The aim of the present study was to investigate the systemic distribution and retention of Cu and Mo in TTM-treated sheep of different breeds and Cu status. Low-Cu Cambridge sheep were divided into a TTM trial group (3.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, on three alternate days per month, for 5 months) and a control group, and were killed at the end of the course or 7 months later. High-Cu sheep consisting of a Cu-supplemented (150 mg/kg) Cambridge group and a North Ronaldsay group were administered TTM as before and compared with untreated controls. Brain, liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, pituitary, adrenals, tests and ovaries were retained for metal analysis. Mo accumulated in all organs including brain and pituitary (P < 0.02) in all TTM trial groups and was retained after cessation of treatment, except in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. Cu was increased (P < 0.02) and retained in the cerebellum and medulla oblongata in the TTM-treated high-Cu Cambridge groups. Brain Cu v. Mo concentrations showed a strongly positive correlation (r. 0.7) in the high-Cu Ronaldsay group 7 months after TTM treatment. It is concluded that TTM is not all excreted but (Mo) is widely distributed and retained in many organs including brain and pituitary.

Quantitative assessment of motor deficits and psychiatric disturbances was correlated with EEG features. We found mainly an increase in delta activity, a decrease in alpha activity combined with a more posterior localisation of the EEG generators in the delta band and a more anterior one in the alpha band in patients compared with healthy controls. The localisation of the EEG generators in the patients with clinical apparent neurological symptoms were in all frequency bands more superficial compared with controls and patients without neurological symptoms. With longer duration of the disease, the lower the premorbid intelligence the more posterior was the delta EEG generator localised. Although the alpha EEG generator was more anteriorly localised with longer duration of the disease and more severe cognitive deficits, it was more superficial with more pronounced psychiatric symptoms, more severe cognitive deficits, lower premorbid intelligence and more pronounced motor disabilities. With more pronounced psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits, the beta EEG generator was more anteriorly localised.

In Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with tetrathiomolybdate, the hepatic Cu concentration was 60 microg/g wet weight, compared to 170 microg/g in untreated rats. In seven brain regions (cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain, hippocampus and cortex) of the Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with tetrathiomolybdate. the Cu concentration (1.5 to 2.3 microg/g) was slightly lower (1.6 to 2.7 microg/g) than in untreated rats. A significant difference between the two groups was found only in the midbrain. Brain Fe concentrations in regions other than the striatum were not changed significantly by the tetrathiomolybdate injections. The hepatic Fe concentration was about 120 microg/g in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats without tetrathiomolybdate. Tetrathiomolybdate injection further increased the concentration to about 250 microg/g. Our results indicated that subcutaneous tetrathiomolybdate injection did not have an effect that stimulated redistribution of Cu and Fe in the seven brain regions examined, although hepatic Cu was markedly decreased and the removed Cu was deposited in kidneys, spleen and testes.

Copper is highly toxic in excess, and results in cellular damage and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). This study addresses changes in expression of copper-related genes and metal accumulation in hyperplastic liver and tumors induced by PP. Male rats were fed diets containing DEHP or clofibrate (CLF) for 3-60 days (hyperplasia) and 4-chloro-6-(2,3 xylidino)-2-pyrimidinyl-thio(N-beta-hydroxyethyl) acetamide for 10 months (HCC). During hyperplasia, an immediate and progressive decrease in serum CP activity was observed (P < 0.05), as were reductions in mRNA levels for both CP and Wilson's disease gene (WD gene, a P-type ATPase) (P < 0.05). Tumor-bearing rats had lower serum CP activity (P < 0.05), and CP and WD gene mRNA levels were reduced in tumors (P < 0.05), and in liver surrounding tumors (SL) (P < 0.05). Metallothionein mRNA showed no consistent changes during hyperplasia. Tumors showed a 2.5-fold induction of metallothionein mRNA (P < 0.05), and a 1.2-fold increase in SL. Temporal increases in liver copper content occurred during hyperplasia, with increases of 2-fold (DEHP) and 3.3-fold (CLF) at 60 days (P < 0.05). Copper content was 2.2-fold higher in tumors (P < 0.05) and 1.7-fold higher in SL; iron did not increase and zinc decreased temporally.

The Zn-binding protein was purified on Sephadex G-75 and G3000SW HPLC columns. and was identified as carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) based on the amino acid sequence of a peptide obtained on lysyl endopeptidase digestion. CAIII is expressed as one of the major Zn-binding proteins in the livers of male rats in an age-dependent manner, a comparable amount of Zn to that of copper, Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) being bound to CAIII at 8 weeks of age. Castration at 4 or 8 weeks of age was shown to reduce Zn bound to CAIII to 47.5% of the sham-operated control level, suggesting that the sex-dependent expression of CAIII is partly regulated by a sex hormone, androgen. The concentration of CAIII in the livers of Long-Evans rats with a cinnamon-like coat color (LEC rats), an animal model of Wilson disease, was also estimated as Zn bound to CAIII and shown to be lower than that in Wistar rats before the onset of hepatitis.

Recently, it has been shown that the copper chelators 1,4,7,11-tetraazaundecane tetrahydrochloride (TAUD) and tetraethylenepentamine pentahydrochloride (TETREN) could be useful for copper mobilization in rats. Because these agents could be potential clinical alternatives to DPA for patients with Wilson's disease who are intolerant to this drug, we examined whether oral administration of TAUD and TETREN could be effective in mobilizing copper in experimental copper-overloaded rats. The efficacy of a combined administration of zinc and DPA, TAUD, or TETREN was also assessed. Rats were copper loaded with 0.125% copper acetate in water for 12 wk. After this period, DPA, TAUD, and TETREN were administered by gavage at 0.67 mmol/kg/d for 5 d, and zinc was given at 2.5 mg Zn/kg/d. Twelve weeks of copper loading resulted in a 32-fold increase in total hepatic copper. TETREN was the most effective chelator in increasing the urinary excretion of copper. However, it did not reduce significantly the hepatic copper levels. In turn, combined administration of zinc and chelating agents significantly reduced the amount of copper found in the feces. Although TAUD and TETREN showed a similar or higher efficacy to DPA in mobilizing copper, concurrent treatment of chelating agents and zinc salts should be discarded according to the current results.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Since electroretinography (ERG) assesses the functional integrity of the retina, it was used along with PRVEP to localize the abnormalities in PRVEP in Wilson's patients. Ten newly diagnosed Wilson's disease patients underwent PRVEP and flash ERG soon after the diagnosis was established. The PRVEP latencies were prolonged in comparison with the controls (P<0.001). Photopic and scotopic A waves and oscillatory potentials were prolonged (P<0. 02) with reduction in amplitudes of photopic A and B waves (P<0.001). Six of these patients were subjected to repeat PRVEP and flash ERG after the clinical improvement with specific therapy. Comparison of the pre and post-treatment visual electrophysiological studies revealed significant reduction in latencies of PRVEP and flash ERG A wave (P<0.05) with increase in amplitudes of P100 of PRVEP (P<0.05), A and B waves of flash ERG (P<0.01). These findings confirm the reported PRVEP changes in WD and in addition demonstrate the reversibility of the retinal dysfunction which partially contributes to the PRVEP abnormalities. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study of ERG in patients with Wilson's disease in the literature. Further, there have been no earlier reports in the literature evaluating the effect of specific treatment on the PRVEP and ERG in Wilson's disease.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

12472971,Copper metabolic defects and liver disease: environmental aspects.,"Anand N Pankit, Sheila A Bhave","Copper (Cu) is an essential trace element for many biological processes. Cu homeostasis is generally well maintained by inbuilt controls in intestinal absorption, biliary excretion and intrahepatic storage. Copper deficiency disorders are rare. Acute Cu toxicity occurs occasionally in accidental poisoning with Cu sulfate. Chronic Cu toxicity in the form of liver cirrhosis and damage to other organs is seen classically in Wilson's Disease (genetic abnormality of Cu metabolism) and in the presumed environmental disorder Indian Childhood Cirrhosis (ICC). The clinical, epidemiological and treatment aspects of ICC are described. The evidence linking ICC to environmental Cu is (i) greatly increased hepatic Cu; (ii) early introduction of Cu contaminated milk boiled or stored in brass vessels; (iii) dramatic decline in ICC throughout the country coincident with change in feeding vessels; and (iv) continued long-term remission in d-penicillamine-treated patients after withdrawal of the drug. The nature and role of a second factor in the causation of ICC remains unclear, although a genetic predisposition is strongly suspected. Scattered reports of an ICC-like illness from the West (Idiopathic Cu Toxicosis, Endemic Tyrolean Infantile Cirrhosis), suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic or both) can lead to the same end stage liver disease-'ecogenetic' disorders.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Hepatic and neurological forms are the most frequent manifestations of this rare disease. In schoolchildren and adolescents symptoms of liver damage predominate. In a retrospective study 19 patients were evaluated with biochemical signs of hepatopathy manifested before the age of 18 years. The diagnosis of WD was established at the age of 7 to 27 years. One female patient was admitted with fulminant hepatic failure which was treated by acute transplantation of the liver in the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medicine in Prague. Only 9 of 18 patients with chronic hepatic affection at the time of diagnosis met the Sternlieb diagnostic criteria. These patients had reduced ceruloplasmin levels (0.08-0.18 g/l) and a high copper content in the hepatic dry matter (783 ug/g +/- 323 [SD]). In the remaining 9 patients the ceruloplasmin level was normal, however, in 8 a high copper content of the hepatic dry matter was found (696 ug/g (+)- 352[SD]. The last patient from this group had Kayser-Fleischer's (K-F) ring. It was possible to confirm the high copper content in the hepatic dry matter only after one year's penicillinamine treatment because at the time of the diagnosis poor coagulation did not permit to perform a liver biopsy. There was a statistically significant difference in the copper content of the hepatic dry matter in patients meeting and not meeting Sternlieb's criteria. Statistically significant differences between both groups were found in the plasma copper levels and in the 24-hour urinary copper excretion. Histological examination of the liver under a light microscope revealed findings from minimal changes associated with the presence of glycogen nuclei in hepatocytes to the picture of active chronic hepatitis.

To evaluate whether living related liver transplantation (LRLT) can correct the copper metabolism in WD patients, we studied two children who underwent LRLT because of fulminant hepatic failure. They were 7 and 13 yrs old at the time LRLT was performed. Serum ceruloplasmin levels, serum copper levels, copper urine excretion, and hepatic copper concentrations were measured. Serum ceruloplasmin levels (16.7 +/- 1.2 mg/dL) and serum copper levels (67.0 +/- 1.4 microg/dL) were lower than the normal range after LRLT in case 1. In both patients, urinary copper excretion was reduced markedly after LRLT, but was not normalized (case 1, 191.2 +/- 182.2 microg/d; case 2, 140.0 +/- 156.7 microg/d). Hepatic copper concentrations were slightly elevated (case 1, 158.8 +/- 44.6 microg/g dry weight; case 2, 147.0 microg/g dry weight) after LRLT in both cases, but did not exceed 250 microg/g dry weight. LRLT is a curative procedure in Wilson's disease presenting fulminant hepatic failure or advanced cirrhosis. However, this study indicates that the conditions of copper metabolism in WD patients undergoing LRLT are similar to those in heterozygous genetic carriers. Because the living related donors are the parents who carry the abnormal gene, LRLT cannot completely restore the copper balance in WD patients.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

To explore the roles of the bacterial ATPase residues homologous to those involved in the human diseases, we have introduced several point mutations into ZntA. The mutants P401L, D628A and P634L correspond to the Wilson disease mutations P992L, D1267A and P1273L, respectively. The mutations D628A and P634L are located in the C-terminal part of the phosphorylation domain in the so-called hinge motif conserved in all P-type ATPases. P401L resides near the N-terminal portion of the phosphorylation domain whereas the mutations H475Q and P476L affect the heavy metal ATPase-specific HP motif in the nucleotide binding domain. All mutants show reduced ATPase activity corresponding 0-37% of the wild-type activity. The mutants P401L, H475Q and P476L are poorly phosphorylated by both ATP and P(i). Their dephosphorylation rates are slow. The D628A mutant is inactive and cannot be phosphorylated at all. In contrast, the mutant P634L six residues apart in the same domain shows normal phosphorylation by ATP. However, phosphorylation by P(i) is almost absent. In the absence of added ADP the P634L mutant dephosphorylates much more slowly than the wild-type, whereas in the presence of ADP the dephosphorylation rate is faster than that of the wild-type. We conclude that the mutation P634L affects the conversion between the states E1P and E2P so that the mutant favors the E1 or E1P state.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

However, it may also present in adolescents or young adults with neurological signs confined to the motor system. The first diagnostic screening test is the estimation of the serum caeruloplasmin and total serum copper concentrations, with calculation of the serum non-caeruloplasmin-bound ('free') copper. Serum caeruloplasmin, which contains copper, is best determined by measurement of its oxidase activity, as the immunonephelometric method measures both caeruloplasmin and the biologically inactive apo-form. Diagnosis may be confirmed by an elevated urinary copper excretion. All close relatives of an identified patient must be screened and, where doubt persists, investigation of the Wilson's gene at chromosome 13q14.3 can be employed. Lifelong follow-up studies are best conducted in a specialist centre. Compliance with chelating therapy (penicillamine or trientine) or administration of the metal antagonist tetrathiomolybdate or zinc is monitored by determination of the serum 'free' copper, which should be maintained at or near 1.6 micromol/L (10 microg/100 mL).

The antioxidant enzyme activities in the Zn-treated group did not change significantly with respect to those in the basal group, except for hepatic glutathione peroxidase activity. Moreover, the biochemical data in the blood of Zn-treated group clearly ascertain no liver damage.

12821289,"Copper toxicity, oxidative stress, and antioxidant nutrients.","Lisa M Gaetke, Ching Kuang Chow","Copper (Cu) is an integral part of many important enzymes involved in a number of vital biological processes. Although normally bound to proteins, Cu may be released and become free to catalyze the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. Data obtained from in vitro and cell culture studies are largely supportive of Cu's capacity to initiate oxidative damage and interfere with important cellular events. Oxidative damage has been linked to chronic Cu-overload and/or exposure to excess Cu caused by accidents, occupational hazards, and environmental contamination. Additionally, Cu-induced oxidative damage has been implicated in disorders associated with abnormal Cu metabolism and neurodegenerative changes. Interestingly, a deficiency in dietary Cu also increases cellular susceptibility to oxidative damage. A number of nutrients have been shown to interact with Cu and alter its cellular effects. Vitamin E is generally protective against Cu-induced oxidative damage. While most in vitro or cell culture studies show that ascorbic acid aggravates Cu-induced oxidative damage, results obtained from available animal studies suggest that the compound is protective. High intakes of ascorbic acid and zinc may provide protection against Cu toxicity by preventing excess Cu uptake. Zinc also removes Cu from its binding site, where it may cause free radical formation. Beta-carotene, alpha-lipoic acid and polyphenols have also been shown to attenuate Cu-induced oxidative damage. Further studies are needed to better understand the cellular effects of this essential, but potentially toxic, trace mineral and its functional interaction with other nutrients.",2003,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

14582469,[Wilson's disease].,"Igor Kovacević, Mirta Zekan","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The Wilson disease protein is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, the malfunction of which results in the toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the hepatic and/or neurological symptoms accompanying this disease. Patients present, generally between the ages of 10 and 40 years, with liver disease, neurological disease of a movement disorder type, or behavioral abnormalities, and often with a combination of these. Because Wilson's disease is effectively treated, it is extremely important for physicians to learn to recognize and diagnose the disease. The laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper content, and elevated hepatic copper concentration. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as more than 200 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are compound heterozygotes. The treatment of Wilson's disease must be life long. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective therapy in most patients. Another chelating agent which has been used successfully as the initial therapy is trientine. The search for new anticopper drugs for Wilson's disease is culminating in two excellent new drugs: zinc for maintenance therapy and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (which is to date still an experimental drug) for initial therapy. Liver transplantation is indicated for the fulminant form and in those patients with severe disease not responding to optimal medical management.

The initial symptom of this female patient was olfactory paranoia at age 17. Although that psychiatric symptom was well controlled under pharmacological treatment for two years, she developed olfactory paranoia as well as sialorrhea, dysarthria and finger tremor at age 20. A year later rigidity was also present in the extremities. At age 23, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was found based on hematological examinations. Because her extrapyramidal symptoms were progressive, she was referred to our department to evaluate her neurologic condition. She was diagnosed as having Wilson's disease based on (1) the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, (2) extrapyramidal signs, and (3) a decreased level of serum copper and ceruloplasmin. T2 and FLAIR images of brain MRI showed hyperintense lesions in the putamen, thalamus and pontine tegmentum. Diffusion-weighted images also showed hyperintense lesions in the thalamus and pontine tegmentum. The biopsy specimen of the liver revealed chronic hepatitis with copper accumulation. Since D-penicillamine treatment was initiated, she has shown no olfactory paranoia and exacerbation of ITP. Her gait disturbance has also improved. Olfactory paranoia and ITP are rare clinical complications of Wilson's disease.

12508671,"[Rare, but important chronic liver diseases].",K P Maier,"The presence of steatosis and inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsies is essential for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These findings are similar to those with alcoholic liver disease. However, in the NASH-situation alcohol doesn't play an important role. Risk factors for the development of NASH are obesity and diabetes. Most of the patients are clinically asymptomatic. This means, that a diagnosis of NASH is a diagnosis of exclusion: Viral induced, autoimmune, metabolic and toxic liver disease have to be excluded. The disease has a benign clinical course. The risk of cirrhosis is low. So far, there is no established treatment. Preliminary reports suggest a positive effect of weight-loss and ursodeoxycholic acid. Wilson's disease, a copper storage disorder, in which biliary copper excretion is reduced, is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Most patients with Wilson disease become symptomatic between the ages of 6 and 15. In about 90% of patients serum ceruloplasmin levels and serum copper concentrations are reduced. Copper excreation is increased. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens reveals fatty infiltration, Mallory bodies and ballooned glycogen nuclei, abnormalities which are also found in alcoholic liver disease. The definitive diagnostic parameter is the quantitative determination of liver copper content (> 250 micrograms/g dryweight). Untreated Wilson disease is always fatal. Lifelong treatment with anti-copper drugs are essential, D-penicillamine being the firstline therapy. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload disease inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The frequency of the disease is high. The first symptoms usually can be found at the age of 20-50 years. Arthralgia develops in up to 50% of the patients. Many organs are involved, most often the liver. The organ is usually enlarged, transaminases are always moderately elevated. Laboratory findings disclose a marked elevation in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. More than 80% of HH-patients are homozygous for the C282Y-mutation in the HFE-gene. The firstline treatment of HH is phlebotomy. Treatment is lifelong. When serum ferritin drops below 50 micrograms/l, the frequency of phlebotomy should be reduced (4-12 per year).

By measuring the urinary copper excretion after adjusting the administration schedules, the appropriate timing for DP administration was investigated. The subjects were three brothers with pediatric WD. The initial daily dose of DP was 5 mg/kg/day, and gradually increased to the maintenance dose of 20 mg/kg/day. Until the maintenance daily dose was reached, DP was administered 2 h after the morning and evening meal. After reaching the maintenance daily dose of DP, the appropriate timing for taking DP was investigated in both the morning and evening. Three schedules of DP administration were compared: 2 h after meals; 30 min before meals (with fasting); and 1 h before the morning and 1.5 before the evening meal (direction 1). The resulting urinary copper excretion on each dosing schedule was compared. Little difference was found in urinary copper excretion on the first two schedules, i.e., 2 h after meals and 30 min before meals. When DP was administered 30 min before meals, urinary copper excretion [microgram/day] was 1173 in the first brother, 918 in the second, and 875 in the third. When DP was administered according to direction 1, however, urinary copper excretion was increased significantly to 1701 in the first brother, 2701 in the second, and 3808 in the third. It is known that the efficiency of urinary copper excretion with DP administration depends on the maintenance of chelating ability after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Our results indicate that the excretion was lower when DP was administered 2 h after or 30 min before meals (with fasting), as recommended in the package insert. Thus to achieve better copper excretion efficiency, direction 1 is recommended for WD patients.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Pregnancies in this group of patients will increase as the management of IMDs in childhood and adolescence improves. Clinicians should be aware of potential complications and consider carefully how best to manage these conditions. Ideally, patients should be followed up in adult life by a specialized clinical team, which can implement a planned approach to conception and pregnancy, but often this is not possible. For disorders where the risk of complications is well established (e.g. phenyl-ketonuria), optimal treatment may lead to a good fetal and maternal outcome.

The clinical presentation includes jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy. Early diagnosis is necessary to prevent complications such as cerebral oedema, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. Early supportive management, in particular intravenous N-acetylcysteine, may be effective but liver transplantation is usually the definitive treatment and thus early referral to a specialist unit for liver transplantation is mandatory. Chronic liver failure may be due to unresolved neonatal liver disease, either inherited biliary hypoplasia or extrahepatic biliary atresia, while in older children, autoimmune liver disease or cystic fibrosis are the commonest causes.

Measurements were performed by 125I-radioimmunoassay. Neither sex differences nor correlation between plasma nociceptin levels and liver function test results were found in Wilson's disease patients. It is suggested that significantly elevated plasma nociceptin level is due to the inhibition of nociceptin-inactivating Zn-metallopeptidases (aminopeptidase N, endopeptidase 24.15) by the toxic copper levels, as it is known that changing the central Zn atom to Cu results in an approximately 50% inhibition in the activity of these enzymes.

Since HCC is known as a hypervascular tumor, anti-angiogenesis is a promising approach to inhibit the HCC development. Trientine dihydrochloride (trientine) is used in clinical practice as an alternative copper (Cu)-chelating agent for patients with Wilson's disease of penicillamine intolerance. In our study, we examined the effect of Cu-chelating agents on tumor development and angiogenesis in the murine HCC xenograft model. Although both trientine and penicillamine in the drinking water suppressed the tumor development, trientine exerted a more potent inhibitory effect than penicillamine. In combination with a Cu-deficient diet, both trientine and penicillamine almost abolished the HCC development. Trientine treatment resulted in a marked suppression of neovascularization and increase of apoptosis in the tumor, whereas tumor cell proliferation itself was not altered. In vitro studies also exhibited that trientine is not cytotoxic for the tumor cells. On the other hand, it significantly suppressed the endothelial cell proliferation. These results suggested that Cu plays a pivotal role in tumor development and angiogenesis in the murine HCC cells, and Cu-chelators, especially trientine, could inhibit angiogenesis and enhance apoptosis in the tumor with consequent suppression of the tumor growth in vivo. Since trientine is already used in clinical practice without any serious side effects as compared to penicillamine, it may be an effective new strategy for future HCC therapy.",2001,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Enzyme-related malfunctions may contribute to severe neurological symptoms and neurological diseases: copper is a component of cytochrome c oxidase, which catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water, the essential step in cellular respiration. Copper is a cofactor of Cu/Zn-superoxide-dismutase which plays a key role in the cellular response to oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, copper is a constituent of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, a critical enzyme in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. A detailed exploration of the biological importance and functional properties of proteins associated with neurological symptoms will have an important impact on understanding disease mechanisms and may accelerate development and testing of new therapeutic approaches. Copper binding proteins play important roles in the establishment and maintenance of metal-ion homeostasis, in deficiency disorders with neurological symptoms (Menkes disease, Wilson disease) and in neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease). The Menkes and Wilson proteins have been characterized as copper transporters and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) of Alzheimer's disease has been proposed to work as a Cu(II) and/or Zn(II) transporter. Experimental, clinical and epidemiological observations in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease and in the genetically inherited copper-dependent disorders Menkes and Wilson disease are summarized.

Neurodegenerative disorders involving mitochondria can be divided into those caused by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) abnormalities either due to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormalities, e.g., chronic external ophthalmoplegia, or due to nuclear mutations of OXPHOS proteins, e.g., complex I and II associated with Leigh syndrome. There are diseases caused by nuclear genes encoding non-OXPHOS mitochondrial proteins, such as frataxin in Friedreich ataxia (which is likely to play an important role in mitochondrial-cytosolic iron cycling), paraplegin (possibly a mitochondrial ATP-dependent zinc metalloprotease of the AAA-ATPases in hereditary spastic paraparesis), and possibly Wilson disease protein (an abnormal copper transporting ATP-dependent P-type ATPase associated with Wilson disease). Huntingon disease is an example of diseases with OXPHOS defects associated with mutations of nuclear genes encoding non-mitochondrial proteins such as huntingtin. There are also disorders with evidence of mitochondrial involvement that cannot as yet be assigned.

Aberrant regulation of copper at the level of intracellular transport has been associated with inherited diseases, including Wilson's disease (WND) in humans. WND results in accumulation of copper and the copper and zinc-binding protein metallothionein (MT) in liver and other tissues, liver degeneration, and neurological dysfunction. The toxic milk (TX) mutation in mice results in a phenotype that mimics human WND, and TX has been proposed to be a model of the disease. We characterized TX mice as a model of altered metal ion and MT levels during development, and after treatment with the metal ion chelators tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and deferiprone (L1). We report that hepatic, renal and brain copper and MT are elevated in TX mice at 3 and 12 months of age. Zinc was significantly higher in TX mouse liver, but not brain and kidney, at both time points. Nodules appeared spontaneously in TX mouse livers at 8-12 months that maintained high copper levels, but with more normal morphology and decreased MT levels. Treatment of TX mice with TTM significantly reduced elevated hepatic copper and MT. Transient increases in blood and kidney copper accompanied TTM treatment and indicated that renal excretion was a significant route of removal. Treatment with L1, on the other hand, had no effect on liver or kidney copper and MT, but resulted in increased brain copper and MT levels. These data indicate that TTM, but not L1, may be useful in treating diseases of copper overload including WND.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Copper (Cu) is an essential metal, and its concentration in the body is regulated at a constant level between excess and deficient ones. Cu accumulating in the livers of Wilson disease patients and its animal model, Long-Evans rats with a cinnamon-like coat color (LEC) rats, is in the form of Cu,Zn-MT, MT being an antioxidant. Contrary to the efficient production of MT in response to excessive accumulation of Cu in LEC rats, Cu-binding to MT only occurs marginally under normal conditions. However, the present study revealed that Cu binds to MT more with a severe Cu-deficiency. Namely, male C57BL/6J mice were fed a Cu-deficient diet (0.037 mg Cu/g) and deionized water containing trientine, and then the concentration and distribution of Cu were determined. It was suggested that the cessation of biliary excretion and limitation of the Cu supply to ceruloplasmin are the first responses on feeding of a Cu-deficient diet, followed by an increase in Cu-MT with maintenance of the Cu concentration in the liver. These results suggest that MT causes the recruitment of Cu in a Cu-deficient environment by sequestering Cu from degraded Cu-enzymes and delivering it to Cu chaperones.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

14664727,Cancer therapy with tetrathiomolybdate: antiangiogenesis by lowering body copper--a review.,"George J Brewer, Sofia D Merajver","A new anticopper drug, tetrathiomolybdate (TM), developed for Wilson's disease, is a very promising antiangiogenic agent. Copper levels lowered into an antiangiogenic window by TM have shown efficacy against cancer in a variety of animal models as well as in patients. The only significant toxicity so far results from overtreatment and excessive bone marrow depletion of copper. The resulting anemia and/or leukopenia is easily treatable by dose reduction or drug holiday. The underlying concept for TM efficacy as an anticancer agent is that when the body's copper status is in the window, cellular copper needs are met and toxicity is avoided. Copper status is relatively easily monitored by following serum ceruloplasmin, a copper-containing protein secreted by the liver at a rate dependent upon the amount of copper in the liver available to incorporate into the protein. The authors speculate that the copper level is a primitive angiogenesis and growth-signaling regulator that has been retained throughout evolution.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Rats receiving 80 mg zinc acetate daily by gavage and control rats receiving no treatment were killed after 1 or 2 weeks. By immunohistochemical and analytical chemical techniques we revealed that treated rats had higher levels of MT in the hepatic and renal cells compared to untreated ones. Tissue Zn concentrations were significantly higher in treated rats compared to untreated whereas Cu concentrations decreased in the liver and kidneys as indicated by analytical chemical analyses. MT levels also decreased with treatment period. A histochemical procedure, obtained using autofluorescence of Cu-metallothioneins, confirms these findings: after 2 weeks, the signal decreased in both the liver and kidney sections. This gives a greater understanding of the mechanism of Cu metabolism in the two tissues considered. These results suggest that Zn acts both to compete for absorption on the luminal side of the intestinal epithelium and to induce the synthesis of MT.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
12242608,Metallothionein and antioxidant enzymes in Long-Evans Cinnamon rats treated with zinc.,"Valentina Medici, Alessandro Santon, Giacomo Carlo Sturniolo, Renata D'Incà, Sabrina Giannetto, Vincenzo Albergoni, Paola Irato","The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat is a mutant animal model for Wilson's disease. It is known that an abnormal accumulation of Cu and Fe in the liver and low concentrations of both ceruloplasmin and Cu in the serum occur in these rats. The accumulation of Cu is explained by the defective expression of the Cu-transporting P-type ATPase gene, homologous to the gene for Wilson's disease (ATP7B). The aim of this work was to clarify the action mechanism of Zn, and to verify the role that this metal plays in LEC rats in short-term treatment experiments (1 and 2 weeks) on concentrations of Cu, Zn, Fe, metallothionein (MT), 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oh(8)dG) and on the activity of antioxidant enzymes. It is well known that Zn induces MT and has the ability to prevent redox-active metals, Cu and Fe, binding to and causing oxidative damage at active sites of Zn metalloenzymes and nonspecific binding sites on proteins. Zn administration reduces Cu and Fe transport from mucosal to serosal intestinal sides through competitive mechanisms. Our findings show that treatment with zinc acetate increases tissue Zn and MT contents and decreases Cu and Fe concentrations in the liver and kidneys, even if hepatic Zn and MT concentrations decrease with treatment period. Induction of MT synthesis by Zn contributes to the reduction in free radicals produced by Cu and Fe. We also observed that the superoxide dismutase (SOD)activity in liver decreases with treatment duration in association with the Cu and Fe liver decrease. However, the SOD activity in kidney increases in untreated rats at 2 weeks relative to those untreated for 1 week.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
11243728,Molecular diagnosis of Wilson disease.,"P Butler, N McIntyre, P K Mistry","Wilson disease (WD) is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. The diagnosis is based on clinical and biochemical criteria but these are increasingly recognized to have low sensitivity. Genetic diagnosis is considered impractical due to the large coding region of the ATP7B gene and extreme diversity of mutations. We assessed the feasibility and utility of genetic diagnosis in WD. The coding region of the ATP7B gene was scanned by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis in 6 cases in whom the diagnosis of WD was uncertain. In addition, we attempted molecular diagnosis in 26 WD patients of similar ethnicity but variable disease manifestations. In 6 individuals in whom the biochemical/clinical diagnosis was uncertain, DNA analyses were useful for assigning their status with respect to WD. Molecular diagnosis identified presymptomatic individuals in families affected by WD and assigned heterozygote carrier or wild-type status to individuals previously diagnosed as affected. In 26 WD patients, 92% of disease alleles were identified. The most common mutations were H1069Q, L936X, and 2532delA representing 48, 10, and 8% of disease alleles, respectively. Three novel mutations were identified: Q898R, 3061(-1)g --> a, and 3972insC. Genetic diagnosis is feasible for WD. Greater application of molecular diagnosis should enable an appreciation of the full spectrum of WD phenotype that is not possible with currently available diagnostic criteria.",2001,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

This resulted in the lack of the entire hippocampal formation. Sip1 mutant mice exhibited death of differentiating cells and decreased proliferation in the region of the prospective hippocampus and dentate gyrus. The expression of the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 was ectopically activated, whereas the activity of the noncanonical Wnt effector, JNK, was down-regulated in the embryonic hippocampus of mutant mice. In cortical cells, Sip1 protein was detected on the promoter of Sfrp1 gene and both genes showed a mutually exclusive pattern of expression suggesting that Sfrp1 expression is negatively regulated by Sip1.

Mutations of the ATP7B gene are responsible for the metabolic dysfunction. Small open studies have reported spinal radiological abnormalities including scoliosis, diffuse bone demineralisation, osteochondritis and occasionally fracture. Prevalence of osteoporosis in young adult patients is debated, ranging from 10%, with normal mean Z-score values, to 43% in adults. Past history of spinal or peripheral fractures might be present in 50% of patients. Articular disorders include arthralgias of large joints, such as knee pain, rare effusions, early onset of radiological features of osteoarthritis and associated osteochondritis of the knee joint. Radiological chondrocalcinosis, an unusual feature in young adults, has to be confirmed. Few patients may develop drug-induced lupus with arthralgias, positive anti-nuclear and anti-histone antibodies, secondary to D-penicillamine, the major copper chelator used in WD. In this orphan disease, small retrospective studies cannot allow ascertaining definite WD-related articular and bone manifestations.

In this case, complications must be anticipated, prevented or at least controlled by the best available therapeutic modalities. There are three main goals for the management of portal hypertension: (i) prevention of the first episode of variceal bleeding largely by non-selective β-adrenoceptor antagonists, which is not generally recommended in children; (ii) control of bleeding by using a stepwise approach from the least to most invasive strategies; (iii) and prevention of re-bleeding using bypass operations, with particular enthusiasm for the use of meso-Rex bypass in the pediatric population. Hepatic encephalopathy management also consists of three main aspects: (i) ruling out other causes of encephalopathy; (ii) identifying and treating precipitating factors; and (iii) starting empiric treatment with drugs such as lactulose, rifaximin, sodium benzoate, and flumazenil. Treatment of mild ascites and peripheral edema should begin with the restriction of sodium and water, followed by careful diuresis, then large-volume paracentesis associated with colloid volume expansion in severe cases. Empiric broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be used for the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bacterial and fungal sepsis, and cholangitis, after taking appropriate cultures, with appropriate changes in therapy after sensitivity testing. Empirical therapies continue to be the standard practice for pruritus; these consist of bile acid binding agents, phenobarbital (phenobarbitone), ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines, rifampin (rifampicin), and carbamazepine. Partial external biliary diversion can be used in refractory cases. Once hepatorenal syndrome is suspected, treatment should be initiated early in order to prevent the progression of renal failure; approaches consist of general supportive measures, management of concomitant complications, screening for sepsis, treatment with antibiotics, use of vasopressin analogs (terlipressin), and renal replacement therapy if needed. Hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension are best managed by liver transplantation. Provision of an adequate caloric supply, nutrition, and vitamin/mineral supplements for the management of growth failure, required vaccinations, and special care for ensuring psychologic well-being should be ensured. Anticoagulation might be attempted in acute portal vein thrombosis. Some CLDs, such as extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), Crigler-Najjar syndrome, and Indian childhood cirrhosis, require special considerations. For EHBA, Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy is the current standard surgical approach in combination with nutritional therapy and supplemental fat and water soluble vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. In type 1 Crigler-Najjar syndrome, extensive phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment, in association with adjuvant therapy to bind photobilirubin such as calcium phosphate, cholestyramine, or agar, until liver transplantation can be carried out. Treating Indian childhood cirrhosis with penicillamine early in the course of the disease and at doses similar to those used to treat Wilson disease decreases the mortality rate by half. New hopes for the future include extracorporeal liver support devices (the molecular adsorbent recirculating system [MARS®] and Prometheus®), hepatocyte transplantation, liver-directed gene therapy, genetically engineered enzymes, and therapeutic modalities targeting fibrogenesis.

21999649,Medical management of chronic liver diseases in children (part I): focus on curable or potentially curable diseases.,"Mortada H F El-Shabrawi, Naglaa M Kamal","The management of children with chronic liver disease (CLD) mandates a multidisciplinary approach. CLDs can be classified into 'potentially' curable, treatable non-curable, and end-stage diseases. Goals pertaining to the management of CLDs can be divided into prevention or minimization of progressive liver damage in curable CLD by treating the primary cause; prevention or control of complications in treatable CLD; and prediction of the outcome in end-stage CLD in order to deliver definitive therapy by surgical procedures, including liver transplantation. Curative, specific therapies aimed at the primary causes of CLDs are, if possible, best considered by a pediatric hepatologist. Medical management of CLDs in children will be reviewed in two parts, with part I (this article) specifically focusing on 'potentially' curable CLDs. Dietary modification is the cornerstone of management for galactosemia, hereditary fructose intolerance, and certain glycogen storage diseases, as well as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. It is also essential in tyrosinemia, in addition to nitisinone [2-(nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione] therapy, as well as in Wilson disease along with copper-chelating agents such as D-penicillamine, triethylenetetramine dihydrochloride, and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Zinc and antioxidants are adjuvant drugs in Wilson disease. New advances in chronic viral hepatitis have been made with the advent of oral antivirals. In children, currently available drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection are standard interferon (IFN)-α-2, pegylated IFN-α-2 (PG-IFN), and lamivudine. In adults, adefovir and entecavir have also been licensed, whereas telbivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, clevudine, and thymosin α-1 are currently undergoing clinical testing. For chronic hepatitis C virus infection, the most accepted treatment is PG-IFN plus ribavirin. Corticosteroids, with or without azathioprine, remain the basic strategy for inducing remission in autoimmune hepatitis. Ciclosporin (cyclosporine) and other immune suppressants may be used for patients who do not achieve remission, or who have significant side effects, with corticosteroid/azathioprine therapy.

Many of these same properties that allow these metals to provide essential biochemical activities and structural motifs to a multitude of proteins including enzymes and other cellular constituents also lead to a potential for cytotoxicity. Organisms have been required to evolve a number of systems for the efficient uptake, intracellular transport, protein loading and storage of metal ions to ensure that the needs of the cells can be met while minimizing the associated toxic effects. Disruptions in the cellular systems for handling transition metals are observed as a number of diseases ranging from hemochromatosis and anemias to neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proved useful as a model organism for the investigation of these processes and many of the genes and biological systems that function in yeast metal homeostasis are conserved throughout eukaryotes to humans.

22071549,Zinc and human health: an update.,"Christos T Chasapis, Ariadni C Loutsidou, Chara A Spiliopoulou, Maria E Stefanidou","The importance of micronutrients in health and nutrition is undisputable, and among them, zinc is an essential element whose significance to health is increasingly appreciated and whose deficiency may play an important role in the appearance of diseases. Zinc is one of the most important trace elements in the organism, with three major biological roles, as catalyst, structural, and regulatory ion. Zinc-binding motifs are found in many proteins encoded by the human genome physiologically, and free zinc is mainly regulated at the single-cell level. Zinc has critical effect in homeostasis, in immune function, in oxidative stress, in apoptosis, and in aging, and significant disorders of great public health interest are associated with zinc deficiency. In many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, several malignancies, neurological disorders, autoimmune diseases, aging, age-related degenerative diseases, and Wilson's disease, the concurrent zinc deficiency may complicate the clinical features, affect adversely immunological status, increase oxidative stress, and lead to the generation of inflammatory cytokines. In these diseases, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causative roles. It is therefore important that status of zinc is assessed in any case and zinc deficiency is corrected, since the unique properties of zinc may have significant therapeutic benefits in these diseases. In the present paper, we review the zinc as a multipurpose trace element, its biological role in homeostasis, proliferation and apoptosis and its role in immunity and in chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, depression, Wilson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other age-related diseases.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

21189128,Reorganizing metals: the use of chelating compounds as potential therapies for metal-related neurodegenerative disease.,"Alison C Badrick, Christopher E Jones","Metal ions, particularly copper, zinc and iron, are implicated in several amyloidogenic neurodegenerative disorders. In the brain, as elsewhere in the body, metal ion excess or deficiency can potentially inhibit protein function, interfere with correct protein folding or, in the case of iron or copper, promote oxidative stress. The involvement of metal ions in neurodegenerative disorders has made them an emerging target for therapeutic interventions. One approach has been to chelate and sequester the ions and thus limit their potential to interfere with protein folding or render them unable to undergo redox processes. Newer approaches suggest that redistributing metal ions has therapeutic benefits, and recent studies indicate that alleviating cellular copper deficiency may be a plausible way to limit neurodegeneration. In this review we discuss the role of metals in amyloidogenic, neurodegenerative disorders and highlight some mechanisms and compounds used in various therapeutic approaches.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

21770477,Therapeutic potential of copper chelation with triethylenetetramine in managing diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer's disease.,Garth J S Cooper,"This article reviews recent evidence, much of which has been generated by my group's research programme, which has identified for the first time a previously unknown copper-overload state that is central to the pathogenesis of diabetic organ damage. This state causes tissue damage in the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina and nerves through copper-mediated oxidative stress. This author now considers this copper-overload state to provide an important new target for therapeutic intervention, the objective of which is to prevent or reverse the diabetic complications. Triethylenetetramine (TETA) has recently been identified as the first in a new class of anti-diabetic molecules through the original work reviewed here, thus providing a new use for this molecule, which was previously approved by the US FDA in 1985 as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease. TETA acts as a highly selective divalent copper (Cu(II)) chelator that prevents or reverses diabetic copper overload, thereby suppressing oxidative stress. TETA treatment of diabetic animals and patients has identified and quantified the interlinked defects in copper metabolism that characterize this systemic copper overload state. Copper overload in diabetes mellitus differs from that in Wilson's disease through differences in their respective causative molecular mechanisms, and resulting differences in tissue localization and behaviour of the excess copper. Elevated pathogenetic tissue binding of copper occurs in diabetes. It may well be mediated by advanced-glycation endproduct (AGE) modification of susceptible amino-acid residues in long-lived fibrous proteins, for example, connective tissue collagens in locations such as blood vessel walls. These AGE modifications can act as localized, fixed endogenous chelators that increase the chelatable-copper content of organs such as the heart and kidneys by binding excessive amounts of catalytically active Cu(II) in specific vascular beds, thereby focusing the related copper-mediated oxidative stress in susceptible tissues. In this review, summarized evidence from our clinical studies in healthy volunteers and diabetic patients with left-ventricular hypertrophy, and from nonclinical models of diabetic cardiac, arterial, renal and neural disease is used to construct descriptions of the mechanisms by which TETA treatment prevents injury and regenerates damaged organs. Our recent phase II proof-of-principle studies in patients with type 2 diabetes and in nonclinical models of diabetes have helped to define the pathogenetic defects in copper regulation, and have shown that they are reversible by TETA. The drug tightly binds and extracts excess systemic Cu(II) into the urine whilst neutralizing its catalytic activity, but does not cause systemic copper deficiency, even after prolonged use. Its physicochemical properties, which are pivotal for its safety and efficacy, clearly differentiate it from all other clinically available transition metal chelators, including D-penicillamine, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol. The studies reviewed here show that TETA treatment is generally effective in preventing or reversing diabetic organ damage, and support its ongoing development as a new medicine for diabetes. Trientine (TETA dihydrochloride) has been used since the mid-1980s as a second-line treatment for Wilson's disease, and our recent clinical studies have reinforced the impression that it is likely to be safe for long-term use in patients with diabetes and related metabolic disorders. There is substantive evidence to support the view that diabetes shares many pathogenetic mechanisms with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Indeed, the close epidemiological and molecular linkages between them point to Alzheimer's disease/vascular dementia as a further therapeutic target where experimental pharmacotherapy with TETA could well find further clinical application.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
20553312,Mapping brain metals to evaluate therapies for neurodegenerative disease.,"Bogdan Florin Gh Popescu, Helen Nichol","The brain is rich in metals and has a high metabolic rate, making it acutely vulnerable to the toxic effects of endogenously produced free radicals. The abundant metals, iron and copper, transfer single electrons as they cycle between their reduced (Fe(2+) , Cu(1+) ) and oxidized (Fe(3+) , Cu(2+) ) states making them powerful catalysts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Even redox inert zinc, if present in excess, can trigger ROS production indirectly by altering mitochondrial function. While metal chelators seem to improve the clinical outcome of several neurodegenerative diseases, their mechanisms of action remain obscure and the effects of long-term use are largely unknown. Most chelators are not specific to a single metal and could alter the distribution of multiple metals in the brain, leading to unexpected consequences over the long-term. We show here how X-ray fluorescence will be a valuable tool to examine the effect of chelators on the distribution and amount of metals in the brain.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The deficiency in function of a particular molybdoenzyme can be critical for the survival of the organism dependent on the pathway involved. However, incapacity in forming a functional Moco has a pleiotropic effect in the different processes involving this cofactor.

Loss of ATP7B function is the basis for reduced hepatic biliary copper excretion and reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin. During the intervening years, there was recognition of the clinical signs, histologic, biochemical features, and mutation analysis of ATP7B that characterize and enable diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of signs of liver or neurologic disease and detection of Kayser-Fleischer rings, low ceruloplasmin, elevated urine and hepatic copper, and associated histologic changes in the liver. Medical therapies and liver transplantation can effectively treat patients with this once uniformly fatal disorder. The earlier detection of the disease led to the initiation of treatment to prevent disease progression and reverse pathologic findings if present, and family screening to detect the disorder in first-degree relatives is warranted. Gene therapy and hepatocyte cell transplantation for Wilson disease has only been tested in animal models but represent future areas for study.

Abnormalities of copper metabolism have been linked with neurologic disorders that affect movement, such as Wilson disease and Menkes disease; however, the diagnosis of non-Wilson, non-Menkes-type copper-metabolism disorders has been more elusive, especially in cases with atypical characteristics. We present here the case of an adolescent with a novel presentation of copper-metabolism disorder who exhibited acute severe hemilingual dyskinesia and prominent tics, with ballismus of the upper limbs, but had normal brain and spinal MRI results and did not show any signs of dysarthria or dysphagia. His serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were low, but his urinary copper level was elevated after penicillamine challenge. We conclude that copper-metabolism disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis for movement disorders, even in cases with highly unusual presentations, because many of them are treatable.

Currently, there are no disease modifying drugs, existing therapies only offer short-term symptomatic relief. Two of the pathognomonic indicators of AD are the presence of extracellular protein aggregates consisting primarily of the Aβ peptide and oxidative stress. Both of these phenomena can potentially be explained by the interactions of Aβ with metal ions. In addition, metal ions play a pivotal role in synaptic function and their homeostasis is tightly regulated. A breakdown in this metal homeostasis and the generation of toxic Aβ oligomers are likely to be responsible for the synaptic dysfunction associated with AD. Therefore, approaches that are designed to prevent Aβ metal interactions, inhibiting the formation of toxic Aβ species as well as restoring metal homeostasis may have potential as disease modifying strategies for treating AD. This review summarizes the physiological and pathological interactions that metal ions play in synaptic function with particular emphasis placed on interactions with Aβ. A variety of therapeutic strategies designed to address these pathological processes are also described. The most advanced of these strategies is the so-called 'metal protein attenuating compound' approach, with the lead molecule PBT2 having successfully completed early phase clinical trials. The success of these various strategies suggests that manipulating metal ion interactions offers multiple opportunities to develop disease modifying therapies for AD.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

MD and OHS are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by a copper deficiency. Typical features of MD, such as neurologic disturbances, connective tissue disorders and hair abnormalities, can be explained by the abnormally low activity of copper-dependent enzymes. The current standard-of-care for treatment of MD is parenteral administration of copper-histidine. When the treatment is initiated in newborn babies, neurologic degeneration can be prevented, but delayed treatment is considerably less effective. Moreover, copper-histidine treatment does not improve connective tissue disorders. Novel treatments targeting neurologic and connective tissue disorders need to be developed. OHS is the mildest form of MD and is characterized by connective tissue abnormalities. Although formal trials have not been conducted for OHS, OHS patients are typically treated in a similar manner to MD. WD is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the toxic effects of chronic exposure to high levels of copper. Although the hepatic and nervous systems are typically most severely affected, initial symptoms are variable, making an early diagnosis difficult. Because early treatments are often critical, especially in patients with neurologic disorders, medical education efforts for an early diagnosis should target primary care physicians.

D-Penicillamine, a potent metal chelator, is an important therapy for Wilson disease. To investigate the changes of metal elements under the treatment of D-penicillamine, we determined the levels of Cu, Zn, Mg, Ca, Fe, Se, Mn, Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Tl, and Al by ICP-MS in 24-h urine of 115 Wilson disease patients who had received treatment with D: -penicillamine for 1 month to 22 years at maintenance doses, as well as 115 age-matched, healthy controls. The levels of Cu, Mg, Ca, Zn, Hg, Pb, Tl, Cd, and Mn in the 24-h urine of the cases were significantly higher than those of the controls (P < 0.05), and the observed increases in the levels of Mg, Ca, and Zn were directly correlated with the treatment duration with Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) of 0.356 (Mg), 0.329 (Ca), and 0.313 (Zn), respectively (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the levels of Al and As in the 24-h urine were lower than those of the controls (P < 0.05) and were negatively correlated with the treatment time with R of -0.337 (Al) and -0.398 (As), respectively, (P < 0.05).

Hepatic phenotype of the toxic milk mice is similar to clinical findings in humans suffering from Wilson's disease (WND). In the present study, neurotransmitter system and locomotor performance in toxic milk mice was examined to verify the feasibility of this animal model for studying neuropathology of WND. Mice aged 2 and 12 months were used in the experiment. The mice were tested according to rotarod and footprint protocols. Monoamine content in brain structures was measured by high performance liquid chromatography. In order to detect neuronal loss, expression of enzymes specific for dopaminergic [tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)], noradrenergic (dopamine beta-hydroxylase) and serotoninergic [tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)] neurons was analyzed by Western blot. The 12-month-old toxic milk mice demonstrated impaired locomotor performance in behavioral tests. Motor deficits were accompanied by increased copper and serotonin content in different brain regions and slight decrease in dopamine concentration in the striatum. The expression of TH, dopamine beta-hydroxylase and TPH in the various brain structures did not differ between toxic milk mice and control animals. Despite differences in brain pathology between humans and rodents, further exploration of neuronal injury in toxic milk mice is warranted to broaden the understanding of neuropathology in WND.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

All investigations were carried out in the best interests of diagnosis and management of patients referred to my clinic. The delay in diagnosis in 18 cases resulted in progression to severe hepatic disease in 14 cases and to neurological disease in 4 cases. One patient had no symptoms at the time her sister's illness was diagnosed as Wilson's disease. In a second patient, with liver disease, the diagnosis was also made when a sister was found to have Wilson's disease. There was a female to male ratio of 15:7. The average age of onset was 12.6 years and the incidence 6.9%. Delay in diagnosis resulted in nine deaths.

23794426,[Therapy for systemic metabolic disorders based on the detection of basic corneal landmarks in childhood].,"W Lisch, S Pitz, G Geerling","Many systemic lysosomal storage disorders show basic corneal opacities already in childhood. The lysosome is a cell organelle, produced by Golgi's apparatus, that is surrounded by a membrane and contains hydrolytic enzymes that break down food molecules, especially proteins and other complex molecules. The ophthalmologist's precise diagnosis of corneal clouding at the slit-lamp may reveal the correct interpretation of the specific lysosomal storage disorder. It is very important to diagnose such diseases as soon as possible because today the development of systemic enzymatic therapies has broadened the therapeutic armamentarium for the current standard of care. The following corneal landmarks of systemic storage diseases and of the modern systemic therapy are presented: cornea verticillata in Fabry's disease, periodic infusion of alpha-galactosidase a; Kayser-Fleischer's ring in Wilson's disease, zinc, trienetin, low copper diet; multiple, punctiform crystals in cystinosis, cysteamine, Raptor RP 103(DR cysteamine) that reduces the cytotoxity in form of continous dissolving of cystine from lysosome, renal transplantation, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; peripheral ring, but not true lipid arc, and moderate stromal haze in LCAT-deficiency, injection of recombinant enzyme or of encapsulated LCAT-secreting cells; diffuse stromal haze in mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Enzyme replacement therapy is currently indicated for MPS I, MPS II, and MPS VI, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; painful, bilateral pseudo-dendritic opacities in tyrosinemia type II (eponym: Richner-Hanhart syndrome), low phenylalanine and tyrosine diet result in complete disappearance of corneal alterations with a consecutive painfree period.

A complex form of copper-associated hepatitis has recently been characterized in the Labrador retriever. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of d-penicillamine treatment for copper-associated hepatitis in this breed, to study the effects on hepatic copper, iron and zinc concentrations, and to evaluate parameters to predict optimal duration of treatment. Forty-three client owned Labrador retrievers that were diagnosed with increased hepatic copper were treated with d-penicillamine and underwent at least one follow-up examination including a liver biopsy for histopathological scoring of inflammatory lesions. Hepatic copper, iron and zinc concentrations were determined in the initial and follow-up biopsies by instrumental neutron activation analysis. The influence of initial hepatic copper concentration, sex, age, d-penicillamine formulation and the occurrence of side effects were investigated for their influence on hepatic copper concentration after a certain period of treatment by generalized mixed modelling. d-penicillamine proved to be effective in reducing hepatic copper concentration and associated inflammatory lesions. Parameters derived from the model can be used to estimate the necessary duration of d-penicillamine treatment for Labrador retrievers with increased hepatic copper concentration.

Since not only copper deficiency but also excess of copper can seriously affect cellular functions, the cellular copper metabolism is tightly regulated. In brain, astrocytes appear to play a pivotal role in the copper metabolism. With their strategically important localization between capillary endothelial cells and neuronal structures they are ideally positioned to transport copper from the blood-brain barrier to parenchymal brain cells. Accordingly, astrocytes have the capacity to efficiently take up, store and to export copper. Cultured astrocytes appear to be remarkably resistant against copper-induced toxicity. However, copper exposure can lead to profound alterations in the metabolism of these cells. This article will summarize the current knowledge on the copper metabolism of astrocytes, will describe copper-induced alterations in the glucose and glutathione metabolism of astrocytes and will address the potential role of astrocytes in the copper metabolism of the brain in diseases that have been connected with disturbances in brain copper homeostasis.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We studied the transcript levels of selected genes related to liver injury, levels of SAHH, SAH, DNA methyltransferases genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b), and global DNA methylation in the tx-j mouse (tx-j), an animal model of WD. Findings were compared to those in control C3H mice, and in response to Cu chelation by penicillamine (PCA) and dietary supplementation of the methyl donor betaine to modulate inflammatory and methylation status. Transcript levels of selected genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation were down-regulated at baseline in tx-j mice, further down-regulated in response to PCA, and showed little to no response to betaine. Hepatic Sahh transcript and protein levels were reduced in tx-j mice with consequent increase of SAH levels. Hepatic Cu accumulation was associated with inflammation, as indicated by histopathology and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver tumor necrosis factor alpha (Tnf-α) levels. Dnmt3b was down-regulated in tx-j mice together with global DNA hypomethylation.

In its absence, Nkx2-1 expression is not repressed, and cells that ordinarily would become cortical interneurons appear to transform toward a subtype of GABAergic striatal interneurons.

Liver disease can cause significant morbidity and mortality in both pregnant women and their infants. Few challenges arise in reaching an accurate diagnosis in light of such physiological changes. Laboratory test results should be carefully interpreted and the knowledge of what normal changes to expect is prudent to avoid clinical misjudgment. Other challenges entail the methods of treatment and their safety for both the mother and the baby. This review summarizes liver diseases that are not unique to pregnancy. We focus on viral hepatitis and its mode of transmission, diagnosis, effect on the pregnancy, the mother, the infant, treatment, and breast-feeding. Autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson's disease, Budd Chiari and portal vein thrombosis in pregnancy are also discussed. Pregnancy is rare in patients with cirrhosis because of the metabolic and hormonal changes associated with cirrhosis. Variceal bleeding can happen in up to 38% of cirrhotic pregnant women. Management of portal hypertension during pregnancy is discussed. Pregnancy increases the pathogenicity leading to an increase in the rate of gallstones.

24209444,Update on Wilson disease.,"Annu Aggarwal, Mohit Bhatt","Wilson disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of chronic copper toxicosis characterized by excessive copper deposition in the body, primarily in the liver and the brain. It is a progressive disease and fatal if untreated. Excessive copper accumulation results from the inability of liver to excrete copper in bile. Copper is an essential trace metal and has a crucial role in many metabolic processes. Almost all of the body copper is protein bound. In WD, the slow but relentless copper accumulation overwhelms the copper chaperones (copper-binding proteins), resulting in high levels of free copper and copper-induced tissue injury. Liver is the central organ for copper metabolism, and copper is initially accumulated in the liver but over time spills to other tissues. WD has protean clinical manifestations mainly attributable to liver, brain, and osseomuscular impairment. Diagnosis of WD is challenging and based on combination of clinical features and laboratory tests. Identification of various high-frequency mutations identified in different population studies across the world has revived interest in developing DNA chips for rapid genetic diagnosis of WD. All symptomatic and all presymptomatic patients require lifelong decoppering with careful clinical tracking. Decoppering ensures that presymptomatic individuals remain symptom free. With judicious decoppering, given time, even patients with severe neurological disability improve and can return to normal life and resume school or work at par with their peers.

We recently showed that TETA is metabolized in vitro by polyamine catabolic enzyme spermidine/spermine-N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT1) and by thialysine acetyltransferase (SSAT2) to its monoacetylated derivative (MAT). The acetylation of TETA is increased in SSAT1-overexpressing mice compared with wild-type mice. However, SSAT1-deficient mice metabolize TETA at the same rate as the wild-type mice, indicating the existence of another N-acetylase respons 2ible for its metabolism in mice. Here, we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of SSAT2 in HEPG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes from the SSAT1-deficient or wild-type mice reduced the metabolism of TETA to MAT. By contrast, 1,12-diamino-3,6,9-triazadodecane(SpmTrien), a charge-deficient spermine analog, was an extremely poor substrate of human recombinant SSAT2 and was metabolized by SSAT1 in HEPG2 cells and in wild-type primary hepatocytes.

Beagles, Beagle-Bedlington terrier cross-breeds homozygous for the COMMD1 gene mutation that causes copper toxicosis, and Labrador retrievers with normal or increased hepatic copper concentrations were investigated. The hepatic copper phenotype was determined by histological evaluation of liver biopsies and measurement of the hepatic copper concentration by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Urinary excretion of copper, iron and zinc was measured via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry under basal conditions and after oral administration of a single dose (20mg/kg bodyweight) of the chelator D-penicillamine. There was a rapid increase in urinary excretion of copper and zinc, but not iron after D-penicillamine administration. This increase was not different between dogs with high or normal hepatic copper concentrations. D-penicillamine-induced urinary copper excretion and the copper/creatinine ratio did not correlate with hepatic copper concentrations in the dogs studied, although basal urinary copper/zinc ratios did correlate with hepatic copper concentrations in Labrador retrievers.

SWI is a high-resolution, fully velocity-encoded gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence that consists of using both magnitude and phase information. We describe briefly the physics behind this sequence and the post-processing techniques used. The anatomy of the midbrain and basal ganglia in normal subjects on SWI is covered. A number of neurodegenerative disorders are associated with abnormal iron deposition, which can be detected due to the susceptibility effects.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

As WD is an inherited disease of the nervous system that is not curable; early diagnosis with early and life-long treatment leads to better prognoses. Currently, the recommended treatment for WD is integrated Chinese and Western medicine. A number of studies indicate that treatment of integrative medicine can not only enforce the de-copper effect but also improve liver function, intelligence, and other factors.

Hence, it is important to keep a high index of suspicion for diagnosing this clinical entity in appropriate clinical settings. The clinical presentation can be quite variable and they may present solely with neurological features sans hepatic symptoms. Such neurological manifestations usually follow subacute to chronic course. Acute onset anarthria as the heralding and predominant presenting feature has been rarely reported in the literature. We reported a case of a 12-year-old girl who presented with acute onset anarthria and dystonia of 1-month duration. On further evaluation, a diagnosis of WD was made.

Phenotypic diversity of the disease can lead to delayed diagnosis. We describe a case of WD in a 10-year-old boy presenting with 3 months of increasingly intense, spasmodic lower extremity muscle cramps. Physical examination revealed tenderness on calf palpation and dark flat lesions over his ankles, knees, and elbows. Initial testing revealed creatine kinase of 302 IU/L (normal 24-248 IU/L), hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL (11.5-15.5 g/dL), aspartate aminotransferase of 114 IU/L (16-52 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase of 54 IU/L (2-30 IU/L), and myoglobinuria. Extensive evaluation of his myopathy, including MRI and muscle biopsy, was negative. Additional laboratory tests revealed a prothrombin time of 21.3 seconds (11.8-15.5 seconds), total bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (<1 mg/dL), direct bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL (<0.3 mg/dL), albumin of 2.1 g/dL (3.1-4.6 g/dL), a reticulocyte percentage of 4.5% (0.5%-2.5%), a negative Coombs direct antibody test, ceruloplasmin of 3 mg/dL (21-51 mg/dL), and 24-h urine copper of 393 μg/24 h (15-60 μg/24 h). Liver biopsy showed patchy advanced fibrosis, mild inflammation, positive staining for copper, and a tissue copper concentration of 768 µg/g (10-35 μg/g). Brain MRI revealed symmetric intrinsic T1 shortening within bilateral basal ganglia. Trientene therapy was initiated for WD. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved and remain normal at 21 months' follow-up. Musculoskeletal involvement in WD is uncommon and typically defined as bone demineralization, arthropathy, or hypokalemic muscle weakness.

It should be considered especially in young patients who have findings of liver disease with unexplained etiology. Clinical presentation of the disease can be variable, and different types of parenchymal changes of the liver can be seen on imaging modalities. Multiple nodular lesions mimicking metastases can be detected. This condition can obligate physicians to screen for a malignant disease. Moreover, it may cause misdiagnosis as advanced stage of disease when coexistent with a malignancy. The coexistence of Wilson disease with some malignant diseases has been reported; however, coexistence with seminoma was not reported before. Approximately 40% of testicular cancers are pure seminoma. Liver metastases are rare in seminoma. In this article, a case of Wilson cirrhosis is reported.

Patient demographics and symptom evaluation are often useful in determining the likely cause, and guide subsequent investigation and management. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is usually caused by neurological conditions where treatment options are limited. Conversely, many of the esophageal causes of dysphagia are amenable to therapy. Gastroscopy is often the first test of choice, given its diagnostic and therapeutic potential, especially when mechanical causes are concerned. Esophageal motor function can be assessed by a variety of techniques, ranging from radiology such as barium swallow, to dedicated motility tests such as manometry and impedance monitoring. The choice of test relies on the clinical indication and the results should be interpreted in conjunction with the patients' symptoms. High-resolution manometry with topography is now the new benchmark for motility studies. Several new techniques for motility testing have also become available, such as esophageal ultrasound and functional lumen imaging probe, but are currently limited to the research setting.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The WD gene codes for a copper transporting P-type ATPase (ATP7B) are located on chromosome 13q14.3. Mutation of this gene disrupts copper homeostasis, resulting in the accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidneys and corneas and copper toxication at these sites. Since the detection of the WD gene in 1993, approximately 300 disease-specific muations have been identified. We recently evaluated a Korean family with WD. The proband, a 17-year-old boy, visited our hospital due to abnormal behaviors including generalized slow movement, dysphagia, drooling and ataxia. Laboratory results revealed decreases in serum copper and ceruloplasmin and an increase in urinary excretion of copper. He had liver cirrhosis, brain lesions and Kayser-Fleischer corenal rings. Molecular genetic analysis of the ATP7B gene demonstrated that he was heterozygous for deletion mutation c.2697_2723del27 in exon 11. Further study of family members revealed that his father and younger brother had the same mutation. The c.2697_2723del27 deletion mutation in exon 11 has not yet been reported as a causative muation of WD and is an in-frame deletion not expected to lead to a frame shift.

25755440,Surgery in a patient with liver disease.,"Rakesh Rai, Sanjay Nagral, Aabha Nagral","Surgery is often needed in patients with concurrent liver disease. The multiple physiological roles of the liver places these patients at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Diseases necessitating surgery like gallstones and hernia are more common in patients with cirrhosis. Assessment of severity of liver dysfunction before surgery is important and the risk benefit of the procedure needs to be carefully assessed. The disease severity may vary from mild transaminase rise to decompensated cirrhosis. Surgery should be avoided if possible in the emergency setting, in the setting of acute and alcoholic hepatitis, in a patient of cirrhosis who is child class C or has a MELD score more than 15 or any patient with significant extrahepatic organ dysfunction. In this subset of patients, all possible means to manage these patients conservatively should be attempted. Modified Child-Pugh scores and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores can predict mortality after surgery fairly reliably including nonhepatic abdominal surgery. Pre-operative optimization would include control of ascites, correction of electrolyte imbalance, improving renal dysfunction, cardiorespiratory assessment, and correction of coagulation. Tests of global hemostasis like thromboelastography and thrombin generation time may be more predictive of the risk of bleeding compared with the conventional tests of coagulation in patients with cirrhosis. Correction of international normalized ratio with fresh frozen plasma does not necessarily mean reduction of bleeding risk and may increase the risk of volume overload and lung injury. International normalized ratio liver may better reflect the coagulation status. Recombinant factor VIIa in patients with cirrhosis needing surgery needs further study. Intra-operatively, safe anesthetic agents like isoflurane and propofol with avoidance of hypotension are advised. In general, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) and benzodiazepines should not be used. Intra-abdominal surgery in a patient with cirrhosis becomes more challenging in the presence of ascites, portal hypertension, and hepatomegaly. Uncontrolled hemorrhage due to coagulopathy and portal hypertension, sepsis, renal dysfunction, and worsening of liver failure contribute to the morbidity and mortality in these patients. Steps to reduce ascitic leaks and infections need to be taken. Any patient with cirrhosis undergoing major surgery should be referred to a specialist center with experience in managing liver disease.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

22962276,Role of the human high-affinity copper transporter in copper homeostasis regulation and cisplatin sensitivity in cancer chemotherapy.,"Macus Tien Kuo, Siqing Fu, Niramol Savaraj, Helen H W Chen","The high-affinity copper transporter (Ctr1; SCLC31A1) plays an important role in regulating copper homeostasis because copper is an essential micronutrient and copper deficiency is detrimental to many important cellular functions, but excess copper is toxic. Recent research has revealed that human copper homeostasis is tightly controlled by interregulatory circuitry involving copper, Sp1, and human (hCtr1). This circuitry uses Sp1 transcription factor as a copper sensor in modulating hCtr1 expression, which in turn controls cellular copper and Sp1 levels in a 3-way mutual regulatory loop. Posttranslational regulation of hCtr1 expression by copper stresses has also been described in the literature. Because hCtr1 can also transport platinum drugs, this finding underscores the important role of hCtr1 in platinum-drug sensitivity in cancer chemotherapy. Consistent with this notion is the finding that elevated hCtr1 expression was associated with favorable treatment outcomes in cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. Moreover, cultured cell studies showed that elevated hCtr1 expression can be induced by depleting cellular copper levels, resulting in enhanced cisplatin uptake and its cell-killing activity. A phase I clinical trial using a combination of trientine (a copper chelator) and carboplatin has been carried out with encouraging results. This review discusses new insights into the role of hCtr1 in regulating copper homeostasis and explains how modulating cellular copper availability could influence treatment efficacy in platinum-based cancer chemotherapy through hCtr1 regulation.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Despite being treatable, there is no universally accepted treatment regimen. Currently, various Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are widely used in the treatment of Wilson's disease in China, but there is a lack of reliable scientific evidence for the effectiveness of such therapies. The objective of this systematic review is to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of CHM as an alternative or/and adjuvant therapy for Wilson's disease. A systematic literature search in different medical databases was performed to identify randomized controlled trials comparing CHM as monotherapy or CHM as adjuvant therapy with western conventional medical therapy in the treatment of Wilson's disease. A total of 687 participants were included in nine eligible studies. The main findings are that CHM as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy for Wilson's disease may be able to improve the clinical symptoms, to promote the urinary copper excretion, to ameliorate liver function and/or liver cirrhosis, and has fewer adverse effects in comparison with western conventional medication. Furthermore, CHM generally appeared to be safe and well tolerated in patients with Wilson's disease. However, the evidence presented in this review are insufficient to warrant a clinical recommendation due to the generally low methodological quality of the included studies. In conclusion, CHM seems to be beneficial and safe for Wilson's disease, but high-quality evidences are still needed to further evaluate this therapy.

Penicillamine (PA) makes 10-50% of the patients with neurologic symptoms neurologically worse at the early stage of administration. The aim of this study was to determine how the copper metabolism changes and whether the change impairs the brain of toxic milk (tx) mice, an animal model of WD, during the PA administration. The free copper and protein-bound copper concentrations in the serum, cortex and basal ganglia of tx mice with PA administration for 3 days, 10 days and 14 days, respectively, were investigated. The expression of copper transporters, ATP7A and CTR1,was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence and Western blot. Then SOD, MDA and GSH/GSSG were detected to determine whether the oxidative stress changed correspondingly. The results revealed the elevated free copper concentrations in the serum and brain, and declined protein-bound copper concentrations in the brain of tx mice during PA administration. Meanwhile, transiently increased expression of ATP7A and CTR1 was observed generally in the brain parenchyma by immunofluorescence, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. Additionally, ATP7A and CTR1 were observed to locate mainly at Golgi apparatus and cellular membrane respectively. Intense staining of ATP7A in the choroid plexus was found in tx mice on the 3rd and 10th day of PA treatment, but rare staining of ATP7A and CTR1 in the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Decreased GSH/GSSG and increased MDA concentrations were also viewed in the cortex and basal ganglia. Our results suggested the elevated free copper concentrations in the brain might lead to the enhanced oxidative stress during PA administration. The increased free copper in the brain might come from the copper mobilized from brain parenchyma cells but not from the serum according to the ATP7A and CTR1 expression analysis.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
22455587,Selective divalent copper chelation for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.,G J S Cooper,"Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been identified by many workers as key pathogenic mechanisms in ageing-related metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases (for example diabetes mellitus, heart failure and Alzheimer's disease). However, although numerous molecular mechanisms have been advanced to account for these processes, their precise nature remains obscure. This author has previously suggested that, in such diseases, these two mechanisms are likely to occur as manifestations of a single underlying disturbance of copper regulation. Copper is an essential but highly-toxic trace metal that is closely regulated in biological systems. Several rare genetic disorders of copper homeostasis are known in humans: these primarily affect various proteins that mediate intracellular copper transport processes, and can lead either to tissue copper deficiency or overload states. These examples illustrate how impaired regulation of copper transport pathways can cause organ damage and provide important insights into the impact of defects in specific molecular processes, including those catalyzed by the copper-transporting ATPases, ATP7A (mutated in Menkes disease), ATP7B (Wilson's disease), and the copper chaperones such as those for cytochrome c oxidase, SCO1 and SCO2. In diabetes, impaired copper regulation manifests as elevations in urinary CuII excretion, systemic chelatable-CuII and full copper balance, in increased pro-oxidant stress and defective antioxidant defenses, and in progressive damage to the blood vessels, heart, kidneys, retina and nerves. Linkages between dysregulated copper and organ damage can be demonstrated by CuII-selective chelation, which simultaneously prevents/reverses both copper dysregulation and organ damage. Pathogenic structures in blood vessels that contribute to binding and localization of catalytically-active CuII probably include advanced glycation end products (AGEs), as well as atherosclerotic plaque: the latter probably undergoes AGE-modification itself. Defective copper regulation mediates organ damage through two general processes that occur simultaneously in the same individual: elevation of CuII-mediated pro-oxidant stress and impairment of copper-catalyzed antioxidant defence mechanisms. This author has proposed that diabetes-evoked copper dysregulation is an important new target for therapeutic intervention to prevent/reverse organ damage in diabetes, heart failure, and neurodegenerative diseases, and that triethylenetetramine (TETA) is the first in a new class of anti-diabetic molecules, which function by targetting these copper-mediated pathogenic mechanisms. TETA prevents tissue damage and causes organ regeneration by acting as a highly-selective CuII chelator which suppresses copper-mediated oxidative stress and restores anti-oxidant defenses. My group has employed TETA in a comprehensive programme of nonclinical studies and proof-of-principle clinical trials, thereby characterizing copper dysregulation in diabetes and identifying numerous linked cellular and molecular mechanisms though which TETA exerts its therapeutic actions. Many of the results obtained in nonclinical models with respect to the molecular mechanisms of diabetic organ damage have not yet been replicated in patients' tissues so their applicability to the human disease must be considered as inferential until the results of informative clinical studies become available. Based on evidence from the studies reviewed herein, trientine is now proceeding into the later stages of pharmaceutical development for the treatment of heart failure and other diabetic complications.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

23050060,The molecular basis of memory.,"Gerard Marx, Chaim Gilon","We propose a tripartite biochemical mechanism for memory. Three physiologic components are involved, namely, the neuron (individual and circuit), the surrounding neural extracellular matrix, and the various trace metals distributed within the matrix. The binding of a metal cation affects a corresponding nanostructure (shrinking, twisting, expansion) and dielectric sensibility of the chelating node (address) within the matrix lattice, sensed by the neuron. The neural extracellular matrix serves as an electro-elastic lattice, wherein neurons manipulate multiple trace metals (n > 10) to encode, store, and decode coginive information. The proposed mechanism explains brains low energy requirements and high rates of storage capacity described in multiples of Avogadro number (N(A) = 6 × 10(23)). Supportive evidence correlates memory loss to trace metal toxicity or deficiency, or breakdown in the delivery/transport of metals to the matrix, or its degradation. Inherited diseases revolving around dysfunctional trace metal metabolism and memory dysfunction, include Alzheimer's disease (Al, Zn, Fe), Wilson's disease (Cu), thalassemia (Fe), and autism (metallothionein). The tripartite mechanism points to the electro-elastic interactions of neurons with trace metals distributed within the neural extracellular matrix, as the molecular underpinning of ""synaptic plasticity"" affecting short-term memory, long-term memory, and forgetting.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In this article, we demonstrate that P57/Gd, a novel prion-based contrast agent, can selectively image tissues with excessive copper accumulation using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). P57/Gd selectivity binds copper(II) over other physiologically relevant cations such as zinc, iron, manganese, and calcium. To simulate a metabolic copper disorder, we treated mice with an intraperitoneal injection of a CuSO(4) solution to induce a renal copper overload.

It is involved in DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and cell division and activation. It is a critical component in many zinc protein/enzymes, including critical zinc transcription factors. Zinc deficiency/altered metabolism is observed in many types of liver disease, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and viral liver disease. Some of the mechanisms for zinc deficiency/altered metabolism include decreased dietary intake, increased urinary excretion, activation of certain zinc transporters, and induction of hepatic metallothionein. Zinc deficiency may manifest itself in many ways in liver disease, including skin lesions, poor wound healing/liver regeneration, altered mental status, or altered immune function. Zinc supplementation has been documented to block/attenuate experimental ALD through multiple processes, including stabilization of gut-barrier function, decreasing endotoxemia, decreasing proinflammatory cytokine production, decreasing oxidative stress, and attenuating apoptotic hepatocyte death. Clinical trials in human liver disease are limited in size and quality, but it is clear that zinc supplementation reverses clinical signs of zinc deficiency in patients with liver disease. Some studies suggest improvement in liver function in both ALD and hepatitis C following zinc supplementation, and 1 study suggested improved fibrosis markers in hepatitis C patients.

The prognosis of such diseases may lead to life threatening conditions, not only because of unabated kidney damage but also because of progressive extra-renal involvement, either in a systemic form (e.g. primary hyperoxaluria type 1, requiring combined liver and kidney transplantation), or in a neurological form (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome leading to auto-mutilation and disability, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase superactivity, which is associated with mental retardation). Patients with other inborn metabolic diseases present only with recurrent stone formation, such as cystinuria, adenine phosphoribosyl-transferase deficiency, xanthine deficiency. Finally, nephrolithiasis may be secondarily part of some other metabolic diseases, such as glycogen storage disease type 1 or inborn errors of metabolism leading to Fanconi syndrome (nephropathic cystinosis, tyrosinaemia type 1, fructose intolerance, Wilson disease, respiratory chain disorders, etc.). The diagnosis is based on highly specific investigations, including crystal identification, biochemical analyses and DNA study.

Only three received trientine as initial therapy [parental choice (two), allergic reactions to penicillamine (one) during the penicillamine challenge], 13 of 16 were converted from penicillamine to trientine because of reactions to penicillamine: haematuria in four, bone marrow suppression in three, neutropenia in three. Trientine was discontinued in three due to allergic rash, low copper excretion and one with compliance problems requiring transplantation. Seventy-five per cent of children presented with chronic liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings were noticed in eight of 16, Wilson Ferenci score range was between 4 and 10 (nl < 4). Laboratory indices remained relatively stable. In line with previous reports, trientine was used mainly as secondary treatment when there were severe side effects with penicillamine.

In the general population, the most frequent cause is non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, which can evolve into steato-hepatitis and cirrhosis. The treatment for steatosis and non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis consists of modifying lifestyles, whereas the effectiveness of drug treatment remains to be determined. Other much less frequent (yet not rare) causes of persistent non-virus non-alcohol related elevations in aminotransferase levels are celiac disease and hemochromatosis, whereas autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and alpha-1-anti-trypsin deficit are rare. Given that some of these conditions are susceptible to treatment, early diagnosis is important. No epidemiological data are available for evaluating the prevalence of elevated aminotransferase levels correlated with the toxicity of drugs or other xenobiotics, including herbal products. The present document, created by a panel of experts based on a systematic review of scientific evidence, is mainly geared towards physicians working in General Medicine and Transfusion Centres, who generally represent the first contact of persons with elevated aminotransferase levels.

Chronic damage results in a progressive accumulation of scarring proteins (fibrosis) that, with increasing severity, alters tissue structure and function, leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Efforts to modulate the fibrogenesis process have focused on understanding the biology of the heterogeneous liver fibroblast populations. The fibroblasts are derived from sources within and out with the liver. Fibroblasts expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin (myofibroblasts) may be derived from the transdifferentiation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells. Other fibroblasts emerge from the portal tracts within the liver. At least a proportion of these cells in diseased liver originate from the bone marrow. In addition, fibrogenic fibroblasts may also be generated through liver epithelial (hepatocyte and biliary epithelial cell)-mesenchymal transition. Whatever their origin, it is clear that fibrogenic fibroblast activity is sensitive to (and may be active in) the cytokine and chemokine profiles of liver-resident leucocytes such as macrophages. They may also be a component driving the regeneration of tissue. Understanding the complex intercellular interactions regulating liver fibrogenesis is of increasing importance in view of predicted increases in chronic liver disease and the current paucity of effective therapies.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We report here the case of a 17-year-old female who presented with fulminant Wilsonian liver failure and intravascular hemolysis. With the subsequent development of encephalopathy and oliguria, single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) was initiated for 5 days to augment copper removal. Continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed using the PRISMA machine, with a blood flow of 100 ml/min and a dialysate flow of 2 L/h for 8 h, then 1 L/h. A 5% albumin dialysate was made by exchanging 1 L of 25% albumin for 1 L of Hemosol BO in a 5-L bag. Single pass albumin dialysis resulted in reductions in serum copper (154 to 59 microg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (37 to 23 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1305 to 729 units/L), and creatinine (1.1 to 0.9 mg/dL) as well as reduced blood transfusion requirements. Cessation of SPAD was followed by three plasmapheresis treatments for further copper removal.

Serum TNF-alpha (P < 0.001), IFN-gamma (P = 0.005) and IL-6 (P < 0.001) were detectable in WD compared with controls. However, serum level elevation of IL-4 (P = 0.49) and IL-2 (P = 0.11), although detectable compared with controls, was statistically insignificant. The disease severity and therapeutic status did not affect the cytokines. Presence of anaemia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia and hepatic dysfunction did not influence cytokine levels. There was a significant negative correlation between IL-6 and ceruloplasmin (P = 0.04) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4) and copper level (P = 0.01).

Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) can be lifesaving for patients with Wilson's disease who present with fulminant liver failure and for patients' unresponsive to medical therapy. The aim of this study was to review our experience with OLT for patients with Wilson's disease.

Six patients underwent transplantation owing to coexistent fulminant hepatic failure and 18 with chronic advanced liver disease with (n = 8) or without (n = 10) associated neurologic manifestations. We performed 3 full-size, deceased-donor OLTs and 22 living-related donor OLTs. Eight patients had a family history of Wilson's disease. We detected a Kayser-Fleischer ring in 18 patients. All patients had a low serum ceruloplasmin level (mean, 27.8 mg/dL) and a high urinary copper excretion level (mean, 4119 mug/d) before OLT. Following successful OLT, there was a significant reduction in urinary copper excretion (median, 37.1 mug/d) in all patients. Mean follow-up was 21.7 +/- 19.8 months (range, 2-60 months). Retransplantation was required in 1 patient at 12 days after the first OLT owing to primary graft nonfunction. Five of the 24 patients died within 4 months of the surgery. The remaining 19 survivors (79%) have remained well, with normal liver function and no disease recurrence. In conclusion, OLT was a curative procedure for Wilson's disease among patients presenting with fulminant hepatic failure and others with end-stage hepatic insufficiency.

For iron, this regulation is achieved by transferrin receptor, DMT1, and ferroportin, whereas mammary gland copper metabolism is regulated by Ctr1, ATP7A, and ATP7B. Zinc homeostasis is complex, involving both zinc importers (Zip3) and zinc exporters (ZnT-1, ZnT-2, and ZnT-4). Both transcriptional and post-translational regulation can affect protein abundance and cellular localization of these transporters, finely orchestrating uptake, intracellular trafficking, and secretion of iron, copper, and zinc.

19414517,Chiral toxicology: it's the same thing...only different.,Silas W Smith,"Chiral substances possess a unique architecture such that, despite sharing identical molecular formulas, atom-to-atom linkages, and bonding distances, they cannot be superimposed. Thus, in the environment of living systems, where specific structure-activity relationships may be required for effect (e.g., enzymes, receptors, transporters, and DNA), the physiochemical and biochemical properties of racemic mixtures and individual stereoisomers can differ significantly. In drug development, enantiomeric selection to maximize clinical effects or mitigate drug toxicity has yielded both success and failure. Further complicating genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition, stereoselective metabolism of chiral compounds can additionally influence pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity. Optically pure pharmaceuticals may undergo racemization in vivo, negating single enantiomer benefits or inducing unexpected effects. Appropriate chiral antidotes must be selected for therapeutic benefit and to minimize adverse events. Enantiomers may possess different carcinogenicity and teratogenicity. Environmental toxicology provides several examples in which compound bioaccumulation, persistence, and toxicity show chiral dependence. In forensic toxicology, chiral analysis has been applied to illicit drug preparations and biological specimens, with the potential to assist in determination of cause of death and aid in the correct interpretation of substance abuse and ""doping"" screens. Adrenergic agonists and antagonist, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, SSRIs, opioids, warfarin, valproate, thalidomide, retinoic acid, N-acetylcysteine, carnitine, penicillamine, leucovorin, glucarpidase, pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, phenylethylamines, and additional compounds will be discussed to illustrate important concepts in ""chiral toxicology.""",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Blood manganese levels were >3000 nmol/L (normal range <320 nmol/L) and MRI revealed signal abnormalities of the basal ganglia consistent with manganese deposition. An older brother with the same phenotype died at 18 years, suggesting a potentially lethal, autosomal recessive disease. This disorder is probably caused by a defect of manganese metabolism with the accumulation of manganese in the liver and the basal ganglia similar to the copper accumulation in Wilson disease. In order to assess the genetic basis of this syndrome we investigated two candidate genes: ATP2C2 and ATP2A3 encoding the manganese-transporting calcium-ATPases, SPCA2 and SERCA3, respectively. Genotyping of the patient and the family for microsatellite markers surrounding ATP2C2 and ATP2A3 excluded these genes. The patient was found to be heterozygous for both gene loci. Despite the unknown pathophysiology, we were able to develop a successful treatment regime. Chelation therapy with disodium calcium edetate combined with iron supplementation is the treatment of choice, lowering blood manganese levels significantly and improving clinical symptoms.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Our working hypothesis is that the fibrotic pathway is copper-dependent. Because biliary excretion is the major pathway for copper elimination, a bile duct ligation (BDL) mouse model was used to test the potential protective effects of TM. TM was given in a daily dose of 0.9 mg/mouse by means of intragastric gavage 5 days before BDL. All the animals were killed 5 days after surgery. Plasma liver enzymes and total bilirubin were markedly decreased in TM-treated BDL mice. TM also inhibited the increase in plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 seen in BDL mice. Cholestatic liver injury was markedly attenuated by TM treatment as shown by histology. Hepatic collagen deposition was significantly decreased, and it was paralleled by a significant suppression of hepatic smooth muscle alpha-actin and fibrogenic gene expression in TM-treated BDL mice. Although the endogenous antioxidant ability was enhanced, oxidative stress as shown by malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenals, hepatic glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio, was not attenuated by TM treatment, suggesting the protective mechanism of TM may be independent of oxidative stress. In summary, TM attenuated BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury and fibrosis in mice, in part by inhibiting TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 secretion. The protective mechanism seems to be independent of oxidative stress. Our data provide further evidence that TM might be a potential therapy for hepatic fibrosis.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Addition of chelating agents to serum containing paramagnetic Cu2+ nulls this effect. This was demonstrated by looking at the effect of adding a chelating agent-D-penicillamine (D-PEN) to CuSO4 and CuCl2 aqueous solutions as well as to rabbit blood serum. We propose that the measurement of water proton spin-lattice relaxation rate constants before and after chelation may be used as an alternative approach for monitoring the presence of free copper ions in blood serum. This method may be used in the diagnosis of some diseases (leukaemia, liver diseases and particularly Wilson's disease) because, in contrast to conventional methods like spectrophotometry which records the total number of both bound and free ions, the proton relaxation technique is sensitive solely to free paramagnetic ions dissolved in blood serum. The change in R(1) upon chelation was found to be less than 0.06 s(-1) for serum from healthy subjects but greater than 0.06 s(-1) for serum from untreated Wilson's patients.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

18265410,Liver disease in pregnancy.,J Eileen Hay,"Abnormal liver tests occur in 3%-5% of pregnancies, with many potential causes, including coincidental liver disease (most commonly viral hepatitis or gallstones) and underlying chronic liver disease. However, most liver dysfunction in pregnancy is pregnancy-related and caused by 1 of the 5 liver diseases unique to the pregnant state: these fall into 2 main categories depending on their association with or without preeclampsia. The preeclampsia-associated liver diseases are preeclampsia itself, the hemolysis (H), elevated liver tests (EL), and low platelet count (LP) (HELLP) syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Hyperemesis gravidarum and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have no relationship to preeclampsia. Although still enigmatic, there have been recent interesting advances in understanding of these unique pregnancy-related liver diseases. Hyperemesis gravidarum is intractable, dehydrating vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy; 50% of patients with this condition have liver dysfunction. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is pruritus and elevated bile acids in the second half of pregnancy, accompanied by high levels of aminotransferases and mild jaundice. Maternal management is symptomatic with ursodeoxycholic acid; for the fetus, however, this is a high-risk pregnancy requiring close fetal monitoring and early delivery. Severe preeclampsia itself is the commonest cause of hepatic tenderness and liver dysfunction in pregnancy, and 2%-12% of cases are further complicated by hemolysis (H), elevated liver tests (EL), and low platelet count (LP)-the HELLP syndrome. Immediate delivery is the only definitive therapy, but many maternal complications can occur, including abruptio placentae, renal failure, subcapsular hematomas, and hepatic rupture. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a sudden catastrophic illness occurring almost exclusively in the third trimester; microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes causes acute liver failure with coagulopathy and encephalopathy. Early diagnosis and immediate delivery are essential for maternal and fetal survival.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
17987273,Liver ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion induces and trafficks the multi-specific metal transporter Atp7b to bile duct canaliculi: possible preferential transport of iron into bile.,"John A Goss, Neal R Barshes, Saul J Karpen, Feng-Qin Gao, Samuel Wyllie","Both Atp7b (Wilson disease gene) and Atp7a (Menkes disease gene) have been reported to be trafficked by copper. Atp7b is trafficked to the bile duct canaliculi and Atp7a to the plasma membrane. Whether or not liver ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion modulates Atp7b expression and trafficking has not been reported. In this study, we report for the first time that the multi-specific metal transporter Atp7b is significantly induced and trafficked by both liver ischemia alone and liver ischemia-reperfusion, as judged by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses. Although hepatocytes also stained for Atp7b, localized intense staining of Atp7b was found on bile duct canaliculi. Inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry analysis of bile copper, iron, zinc, and manganese found a corresponding significant increase in biliary iron. In our attempt to determine if the increased biliary iron transport observed may be a result of altered bile flow, lysosomal trafficking, or glutathione biliary transport, we measured bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity, and glutathione content. No significant difference was found in bile flow, bile acid phosphatase activity, and glutathione, between control livers and livers subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. Thus, we conclude that liver ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion induction and trafficking Atp7b to the bile duct canaliculi may contribute to preferential iron transport into bile.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

19021531,Atp7b-/- mice as a model for studies of Wilson's disease.,Svetlana Lutsenko,"Wilson's disease is a severe human disorder of copper homoeostasis. The disease is associated with various mutations in the ATP7B gene that encodes a copper-transporting ATPase, and a massive accumulation of copper in the liver and several other tissues. The most frequent disease manifestations include a wide spectrum of liver pathologies as well as neurological and psychiatric abnormalities. A combination of copper chelators and zinc therapy has been used to prevent disease progression; however, accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease remains challenging. Similarly, side effects of treatments are common. To understand better the biochemical and cellular basis of Wilson's disease, several animal models have been developed.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the cooccurrence of EbetaT and WD. As both the conditions are associated with variable degrees of hemolysis, WD in the setting of EbetaT may remain masked and consequently remain undiagnosed for a long time.

18598583,Biomarkers of copper status: a brief update.,"Linda J Harvey, Harry J McArdle","The essentiality of copper (Cu) in humans is demonstrated by various clinical features associated with deficiency, such as anaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and bone malformations. Despite significant effort over several decades a sensitive and specific Cu status biomarker has yet to be identified. The present article updates a comprehensive review recently published by the authors which assesses the reliability and robustness of current biomarkers and outlines the on-going search for novel indicators of status(1). The essential features of this earlier review are reiterated whilst considering whether there are other approaches, not yet tested, which may provide valuable information in the quest for an appropriate measure of copper status. Current biomarkers include a range of cuproenzymes such as the acute phase protein caeruloplasmin and Cu-Zn-superoxide dismutase all of which are influenced by a range of other dietary and environmental factors. A recent development is the identification of the Cu chaperone, CCS as a potential biomarker; although its reliability has yet to be established. This appears to be the most promising potential biomarker, responding to both Cu deficiency and excess. The potential for identifying a 'suite' of biomarkers using high-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics and proteomics is only now being examined. A combination of these technologies in conjunction with a range of innovative metal detection techniques is essential if the search for robust copper biomarkers is to be successful.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

However, there is still significant controversy over whether it is an excess or a deficiency of copper to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous studies support the hypothesis that an excess of copper contributes to AD, but experimental evidence in transgenic mouse models seems to suggest the contrary, and at least one clinical study shows that cognitive decline correlates positively with low copper levels. We have recently reported on a deregulation of the ceruloplasmin-copper relationship, specific to AD patients, consisting of an elevation of the copper pool not bound to ceruloplasmin, i.e. 'free' copper. This phenomenon could provide an explanation of the contrasting results obtained in clinical studies. Several clinical trials have been attempted in search of an anti-metal effect counteracting AD progression. Some of them have delivered encouraging results indicating that ""metal protein attenuating compounds"" can indeed alter positively the progression of the disease.

However, to date, eye movements in WD patients were rarely investigated and the data concerning this issue are sparse. The purpose of this study was to evaluate reflexive and voluntary eye movements in WD patients. We examined horizontal saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements using infra-red oculography in 50 WD patients, including 29 neurologically symptomatic (WDn) and 21 asymptomatic ones (WDa), and in 29 healthy controls. We found statistically significant increase in mean antisaccadic latency (378 ms) and in mean antisaccadic error rate (22.5) in the WDn group, when compared with WDa group (317 ms and 9.1, respectively) and controls (318 ms and 9.7, respectively). In contrast, there were no statistically significant differences in mean latency of prosaccades and in size of the gap effect.

Despite decades of clinical use, knowledge of its pharmacology in human subjects remains incomplete. Here, we first used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect and identify major metabolites of TETA in human plasma and urine, and then used this method to measure concentrations of TETA and its metabolites in the urine of healthy and diabetic subjects who were administered increasing doses (300, 600, 1200, and 2400 mg) of TETA orally. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were performed before and after dosing participants. Two major metabolites of TETA were detected in human urine, N(1)-acetyltriethylenetetramine (MAT) and N(1),N(10)-diacetyltriethylenetetramine, the latter being novel. Both metabolites were verified with synthetic standards by LC-MS. The proportion of unchanged TETA excreted as a fraction of total urinary drug-derived molecules was significantly higher in healthy than in matched diabetic subjects, consistent with a higher rate of TETA metabolism in the latter. TETA-evoked increases in urinary Cu excretion in nondiabetic subjects were more closely correlated with parent drug concentrations than in diabetic subjects, whereas, by contrast, urinary Cu was more closely associated with the sum of TETA and MAT. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MAT could play a significant role in the molecular mechanism by which TETA extracts Cu(II) from the systemic compartment in diabetic subjects.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Pretreatment with iron chelators desferal, clioquinol, VK-28 and M30 are neuroprotective in both models. To determine the specificity of chelation neuroprotective activity we have examined the effect of D-penicillamine, a relatively specific copper chelator, in the mice model of MPTP-induced dopamine depletion. Our studies show that D-penicillamine, employed for removal of copper in Wilson disease is relatively weak in preventing dopaminergic neurotoxicity induced by MPTP, as compared to iron chelators previously studied.

The disease typically manifests at late childhood or in young adults with hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. Being fatal without medical treatment or liver transplantation the long-term outcome of Wilson disease depends on the adherence to an effective treatment. Because current medical treatment options are not effective in all Wilson disease patients and adherence to therapy is a problem, gene therapy might represent an alternative curative future therapy. In the rat model of Wilson disease adenoviral and lentiviral gene transfer studies could prove that viral gene transfer is therapeutically effective and can reverse clinical symptoms. However, both approaches were limited by a more or less transient transgene expression. As several tactics can be used to overcome these current limitations, gene therapy approaches may become more efficient than standard medical treatment for Wilson disease in the future.

17219055,The structure and function of heavy metal transport P1B-ATPases.,"José M Argüello, Elif Eren, Manuel González-Guerrero","P(1B)-type ATPases transport heavy metals (Cu+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Pb2+) across membranes. Present in most organisms, they are key elements for metal homeostasis. P(1B)-type ATPases contain 6-8 transmembrane fragments carrying signature sequences in segments flanking the large ATP binding cytoplasmic loop. These sequences made possible the differentiation of at least four P(1B)-ATPase subgroups with distinct metal selectivity: P(1B-1): Cu+, P(1B-2): Zn2+, P(1B-3): Cu2+, P(1B-4): Co2+. Mutagenesis of the invariant transmembrane Cys in H6, Asn and Tyr in H7 and Met and Ser in H8 of the Archaeoglobus fulgidus Cu+-ATPase has revealed that their side chains likely coordinate the metals during transport and constitute a central unique component of these enzymes. The structure of various cytoplasmic domains has been solved. The overall structure of those involved in enzyme phosphorylation (P-domain), nucleotide binding (N-domain) and energy transduction (A-domain), appears similar to those described for the SERCA Ca2+-ATPase. However, they show different features likely associated with singular functions of these proteins. Many P(1B)-type ATPases, but not all of them, also contain a diverse arrangement of cytoplasmic metal binding domains (MBDs). In spite of their structural differences, all N- and C-terminal MBDs appear to control the enzyme turnover rate without affecting metal binding to transmembrane transport sites. In addition, eukaryotic Cu+-ATPases have multiple N-MBD regions that participate in the metal dependent targeting and localization of these proteins. The current knowledge of structure-function relationships among the different P(1B)-ATPases allows for a description of selectivity, regulation and transport mechanisms. Moreover, it provides a framework to understand mutations in human Cu+-ATPases (ATP7A and ATP7B) that lead to Menkes and Wilson diseases.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

This article reports the findings of two of many undergraduate research projects directed by Ed Stiefel in the hopes that the results will be inspiring and useful to the scientific community. The neurological disorders associated with insufficient copper in Menkes disease and an excess of copper in Wilson's disease are well established; however, recent evidence suggests that copper may also be involved in other disorders, such as Alzheimer's, angiogenesis, and prion diseases. The exact role of copper, however, is uncertain. This study examines the role of copper and zinc in the formation of protein deposits and the chelation and removal of the metal ions to reverse the process. The bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein forms a precipitate after the addition of approximately 6 copper(II) atoms or 8 zinc(II) atoms. Other metal ions, such as Ca(II), Al(III), Ni(II), and Co(II), did not precipitate the BSA even when the metal ion to BSA ratios were in excess of 1000. The copper and zinc protein precipitates returned to solution after addition of the chelating agents, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or tetrathiometallates [(MS(4)(2-)), where M=Mo, W]. Two new choline and acetylcholine tetrathiomolybdate and tetrathiotungstate chelating agents have been synthesized and characterized. The infrared (IR) and X-ray crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the (MS(4)(2-)) cores had approximate T(d) symmetry in the choline (Ch) salts and C(2v) symmetry in the acetylcholine (AcCh) salts. The AcCh salts hydrolyzed more slowly than the ammonium or Ch salts and the tetrathiotungstate salts hydrolyzed approximately two orders of magnitude more slowly than the tetrathiomolybdate salts. The slower hydrolysis of tetrathiotungstate may make it more useful as an inorganic reagent and therapeutic agent.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Chelation agents such as the dithiols sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfate (DMPS) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) are the treatments of choice for mercury toxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a disulfide, and its metabolite dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a dithiol, have also been shown to have chelation properties when used in an appropriate manner. Whilst N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) have been recommended in the treatment of mercury toxicity in the past, an examination of available evidence suggests these agents may in fact be counterproductive. Zinc and selenium have also been shown to exert protective effects against mercury toxicity, most likely mediated by induction of the metal binding proteins metallothionein and selenoprotein-P. Evidence suggests however that the co-administration of selenium and dithiol chelation agents during treatment may also be counter-productive. Finally, the issue of diagnostic testing for chronic, historical or low dose mercury poisoning is considered including an analysis of the influence of ligand interactions and nutritional factors upon the accuracy of ""chelation challenge"" tests.",2007,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Aspects of the high yielding synthesis of sarar and strategies for its conjugation to a range of antibodies for targeting colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma and melanoma are described. Free and conjugated to proteins sarar can complex (64)Cu(II) rapidly at room temperature and quantitatively; the latter leading to products of high specific activity and purity. The full occupation of the (64)Cu(II) ions 6 coordination sites by the sarar cage prevents the ready exchange of the (64)Cu(II) from the cage and is the rational for the extraordinary thermodynamic and kinetic stability of (64)Cu(II) labelled sarar and its conjugates. It's in vivo stability is further highlighted by the low uptake and retention of (64)Cu-sarar-conjugated antibodies in the liver. Finally, the prospects for the use of the sarar technology in the materials science arena for probing solid liquid interfaces, in particular, the quantification of functional groups on microspheres and in the engineering of novel materials are discussed.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

It is listed as a status 1 indication according to the United Network for Organ Sharing classification. A massive amount of copper released during the attack induces hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure. Conventional chelating therapy attempting to remove copper from the patient is not satisfactory because there is inadequate time for these drugs to take action and patients are usually oliguric. The Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS) is a form of modified dialysis that removes putative albumin-bound toxins associated with liver failure. It is believed that extracorporeal albumin dialysate absorbs the circulating copper molecules that are trapped in the patient's circulation. We report 2 patients with acute decompensated Wilson disease treated with MARS. In the first case, the patient was started on MARS once conventional treatment failed. A significant amount of copper was removed from her circulatory system, and her condition stabilized afterwards. The treatment gained her extra time, and she was eventually bridged to liver transplantation. In the second case, the patient was started on MARS treatment early in the course of his illness, and his condition soon stabilized after the treatment. He was able to return to his home country for liver transplantation. In both cases, MARS was used as a means of preventing deterioration rather than salvaging devastation. In conclusion, MARS may confer benefits to patients with acute decompensated Wilson disease if it is started early in the course of illness.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We have found efficacious results of TM therapy in mouse models of fibrosis; inflammation; damage from exogenous agents, such as acetaminophen and doxorubicin; and immune-modulated diseases, such as concanavalin A hepatitis, collagen II-induced arthritis, and the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type I diabetes. In the current study, we examine TM efficacy in the EAE mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). We find that clinical scores of neurologic damage are significantly inhibited by TM therapy, whether therapy is started before MS-inducing antigen administration or after symptoms from antigen administration develop. Furthermore, we find that experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) treatment produces a marked increase of oxidant damage, as measured by urine isoprostane levels, and TM suppresses these isoprostane increases strongly and significantly.

Internalized radionuclides may cause both acute and chronic radiation injury and increase an individual's risk of developing cancer. This damage and risk can be mitigated by the use of decorporation agents that reduce internal contamination. Unfortunately, most effective agents decorporate only a limited range of radionuclides, and some are formulated in ways that would make administration in mass casualty situations challenging. There is a need for new radionuclide decorporation agents, reformulations of existing agents, and/or expansion of the labeled indications for existing treatments.

There is an established place for liver transplantation in the presence of liver disease, while the indication for neurologic manifestations is debated. Between 1993 and 2005, 11 patients were liver transplanted for Wilson's disease at our institution. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the patients. The pathology of the explanted livers was analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups based on the evolution of the disease. Postoperative data gathered included patient and graft outcome, complications, neurologic status, and copper metabolism. Six males and five females were transplanted at a mean age of 29.7 yr (range 15-48 yr). Three patients had a fulminant presentation, two patients had decompensation of established disease, and six patients had chronic disease. Neurologic features were prominent in five patients. The pathologic analysis of the explanted graft showed cirrhosis in all patients. The five patients with fulminant and acute on chronic presentations also showed necrosis in the explant. The mean postoperative follow-up was 56.8 months (range 10-129 months). Two patients were re-transplanted. One patient died because of severe sepsis. Two patients with severe neurologic dysfunction showed significant remission of symptoms.

Cancer cells and normal cells require essential metal ions such as iron, copper and zinc for growth and proliferation. Chelators can target the metabolic pathways of cancer cells through the control of proteins involved in the regulation of these metals and also of other molecules involved in cell cycle control, angiogenesis and metastatic suppression. Other targets include the inhibition of specific proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase involved in DNA synthesis, the inhibition of free radical damage on DNA caused by iron and copper catalytic centers, the inhibition of microbial growth in immuno compromised cancer patients and the decorporation of radioactive and other toxic metals causing cancer. Chelating drugs and metal ions can affect the metabolism, efficacy and toxicity of anti-cancer drugs such as doxorubicin, mitozantrone, bleiomycin and hydroxyurea (HU). Although many experimental chelators have been shown to be effective as anti-cancer agents, only a few, e.g., dexrazoxane, deferoxamine (DFO) and triapine, have reached the stage of clinical testing or application. In many experimental models, deferiprone (L1) has been shown to be effective in cancer prevention and treatment, and in the inhibition of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

19075668,Copper transport systems are involved in multidrug resistance and drug transport.,"Tatsuhiko Furukawa, Masaharu Komatsu, Ryuji Ikeda, Kazutake Tsujikawa, Shin-ichi Akiyama","Copper is an essential trace element and several copper containing proteins are indispensable for such processes as oxidative respiration, neural development and collagen remodeling. Copper metabolism is precisely regulated by several transporters and chaperone proteins. Copper Transport Protein 1 (CTR1) selectively uptakes copper into cells. Subsequently three chaperone proteins, HAH1 (human atx1 homologue 1), Cox17p and CCS (copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase) transport copper to the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase respectively. Defects in the copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B are responsible for Menkes disease and Wilson's disease respectively. These proteins transport copper via HAH1 to the Golgi apparatus to deliver copper to cuproenzymes. They also prevent cellular damage from an excess accumulation of copper by mediating the efflux of copper from the cell. There is increasing evidence that copper transport mechanisms may play a role in drug resistance. We, and others, found that ATP7A and ATP7B are involved in drug resistance against the anti-tumor drug cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP). A relationship between the expression of ATP7A or ATP7B in tumors and CDDP resistance is supported by clinical studies. In addition, the copper uptake transporter CTR1 has also been reported to play a role in CDDP sensitivity. Furthermore, we have recently found that the effect of ATP7A on drug resistance is not limited to CDDP. Using an ex vivo drug sensitivity assay, the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA), the expression of ATP7A in human surgically resected colon cancer cells correlated with sensitivity to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38). ATP7A-overexpressing cells are resistant to many anticancer drugs including SN-38, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin (CPT-11), vincristine, paclitaxel, etoposide, doxorubicin (Dox), and mitoxantron. The mechanism by which ATP7A and copper metabolism modulate drug transport appears to involve modulation of drug cellular localization via modulation of the vesicle transport system. In ATP7A overexpressing cells, Dox accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. In contrast, in the parental cells, Dox is localized in the nuclei, where the target molecules of Dox, topoisomerase II and DNA, are found. Disruption of the intracellular vesicle transport system with monensin, a Na+/H+ ionophore, induced the relocalization of Dox from the Golgi apparatus to the nuclei in the ATP7A overexpressing cells. These data suggested that ATP7A-related drug transport is dependent on the vesicle transport system. Thus copper transport systems play important roles in drug transport as well as in copper metabolism. Components of copper metabolism are therefore likely to include target molecules for the modulation of drug potency of not only anti-cancer agents but also of other drugs.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

At baseline, two of the 12 patients with hepatic disease exhibited decompensated cirrhosis, five exhibited compensated cirrhosis, and five had less severe disease. Both patients with decompensated cirrhosis improved to a compensated state after initiation of therapy. Two of the five patients with initial compensated cirrhosis progressed to decompensated state, and three remain stable.

19177468,Chelation therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.,"Silvia Bolognin, Denise Drago, Luigi Messori, Paolo Zatta","Mounting evidence suggests a central role for transition biometals in the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (ND). Indeed, while studying the molecular basis for this heterogeneous group of diseases, it has become increasingly evident that biometals and nonphysiological Al are often involved in pathology onset and progression, either by affecting the conformation of specific proteins or by exacerbating local oxidative stress. The apparently critical role played by metal dishomeostasis in ND makes chelation therapy an attractive pharmacological option. However, classical metal chelation approaches, relying on potent metal ligands, turned out to be successful only in those rare cases where exceptional brain metal accumulation occurs due to specific defects in metal metabolism. In contrast, metal-targeted approaches using ligand of intermediate strength seem to be more appropriate in fighting the major ND, although their benefits are still questioned. We report here a survey of recent evidences supporting the use of a variety of metal ligands, and even functionalized nanoparticles, for the treatment of the most common ND. The beneficial neuropharmacological actions of metal-targeted agents most likely arise from local metal redistribution rather than from massive metal removal. The perspectives for the development of new effective agents against ND are critically discussed.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

19968254,Risks of copper and iron toxicity during aging in humans.,George J Brewer,"Copper and iron are essential but also toxic metals. Their essentiality is known, but their toxicity, except for the genetic overload diseases, Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis, is not so well known. Yet, their toxicities are so general in the population that they are a looming public health problem in diseases of aging and in the aging process itself. Both metals are transition elements, and their resulting redox properties have been used during evolution in the development of oxidative energy generation. But both contribute to the production of excess damaging oxidant radicals. Evolution has kept stores of copper and iron in excess during the reproductive years because they are so vital to life. But the oxidant damage from these excess stores of metals builds up as we age, and natural selection ceases to act after about age 50 since diseases after that do not contribute to reproductive fitness. Diseases of aging such as Alzheimer's disease, other neurodegenerative diseases, arteriosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and others may all be contributed to by excess copper and iron. A very disturbing study has found that in the general population those in the highest fifth of copper intake, if they are also eating a relatively high fat diet, lose cognition at over three times the normal rate. Inorganic copper in drinking water and in supplements is handled differently than food copper and is therefore more toxic. Trace amounts of copper in drinking water, less than one-tenth of that allowed in human drinking water by the Environmental Protection Agency, greatly enhanced an Alzheimer's-like disease in an animal model.

Metals like iron and copper are essential for life, but they are also involved in several neurodegenerative mechanisms such as protein aggregation, free radical generation and oxidative stress. The role of Fe and Cu, their pathogenic mechanisms and possible therapeutic relevance are discussed regarding four of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Metal-mediated oxidation by Fenton chemistry is a common feature for all those disorders and takes part of a self-amplifying damaging mechanism, leading to neurodegeneration. The interaction between metals and proteins in the nervous system seems to be a crucial factor for the development or absence of neurodegeneration. The present review also deals with the therapeutic strategies tested, mainly using metal chelating drugs. Metal accumulation within the nervous system observed in those diseases could be the result of compensatory mechanisms to improve metal availability for physiological processes.",2010,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

20232410,Influence of copper on early development: prenatal and postnatal considerations.,"Janet Y Uriu-Adams, Rachel E Scherr, Louise Lanoue, Carl L Keen","Copper (Cu) is an essential nutrient whose requirement is increased during pregnancy and lactation. These represent times of critical growth and development, and the fetus and neonate are particularly vulnerable to deficiencies of this nutrient. Genetic mutations that predispose the offspring to inadequate stores of Cu can be life threatening as is observed in children with Menkes disease. During the last decade, severe Cu deficiency, once thought to be a rare condition, has been reported in the literature at an increasing frequency. Secondary Cu deficiencies can be induced by a variety of ways such as excessive zinc or iron intake, certain drugs, and bariatric surgery. Premature and low birth weight infants can be born with low Cu stores. A number of mechanisms can contribute to the teratogenicity of Cu including decreased activity of select cuproenzymes, increased oxidative stress, decreased nitric oxide availability, altered iron metabolism, abnormal extracellular matrix protein crosslinking, decreased angiogenesis and altered cell signaling among others. The brain, heart, and vessels as well as tissues such as lung, skin and hair, and systems including the skeletal, immune, and blood systems, are negatively affected by suboptimal Cu during development. Additionally, persistent structural, biochemical, and functional adverse effects in the offspring are noted even when Cu supplementation is initiated after birth, supporting the concept that adequate Cu nutriture during pregnancy and lactation is critical for normal development. Although Cu-containing IUDs are an effective method for increasing intrauterine Cu concentrations and for reducing the risk of pregnancy, high amounts of dietary Cu are not thought to represent a direct developmental risk.",2010,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

But it was another metal that towered above the Jerusalem landscape during the meeting of the International Society for Zinc Biology (ISZB; http://www.iszb.org/), held at Mishkenot Sha'ananim, a whisper away from the Old City walls. More than 100 scientists gathered on 1 to 5 December 2009 to discuss their research on the biology of this metal. Zinc is a double-edged sword. Zinc supplementation accelerates wound healing and growth and promotes an effective immune response. On the other hand, zinc deficiency leads to growth retardation and impaired learning and memory function, and has been linked to mood disorders. At the cellular level, however, uncontrolled increases in zinc concentrations can lead to neuronal cell death and may be involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Through regulation of various intracellular signaling pathways, zinc can accelerate cell growth and possibly contribute to cancer. However, despite the physiological and clinical importance of this metal, research on the molecular basis of these effects is still in its infancy.

During CLD the extracellular matrix undergoes a process of remodelling, leading to new collagen formation and deposition. Tissue remodelling is regulated by fine molecular mechanisms, involving proteases, inhibitors and growth factors. The major role in matrix degradation is played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a class of zinc and calcium-dependent enzymes, and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). Along with the progress in diagnostic techniques, leading to more precise and less invasive methods, the concept of monitoring has gained importance for the clinical management of CLD. At the present state of our knowledge, liver biopsy still represents an essential procedure for staging liver disease. However, despite its importance, liver biopsy presents some limitations: the risk of a disease underestimation is the most significant one, as hepatic lesions are often irregularly located within the liver. Parallel to the limitations of liver biopsy, clinical needs for an early identification of progressive fibrosis require additional non-invasive techniques to be developed. In this review we discuss the major problems concerning this important clinical necessity. Moreover, we focus on the role of MMPs and TIMPs in the pathogenesis of CLD, as well as their possible use as non-invasive serum markers for inflammation and fibrosis in this pathology.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Genetic defect is in the gene coding ATPase type P (ATP7B). The inheritance is autosomal recessive. Up to now, more then 500 mutations causing Wilson's disease were described. The most frequent mutation in Central Europe is mutation H1069Q. The manifestation of Wilson's disease is usually hepatic or neurologic. Hepatic form is manifested by acute or chronic hepatitis, steatosis or cirrhosis. Neurologic involvement is manifested usually after 20 year of age by motor disturbances (tremor, disturbed speech, problems with writing), which could progress into severe extrapyramidal syndrome with tremor, rigidity, dysartria, dysfagia and muscle contracture. Diagnosis is based on clinical and laboratory examinations (neurologic symptoms, liver disease, low serum ceruloplasmin levels, elevated free copper concentration in serum, high urine copper excretion, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings). Confirmation of diagnosis is done by hepatic copper concentration in liver biopsy or by genetic examination. Untreated disease leads to the death of a patient. Treatment is based on chelating agents decreasing the copper content by excretion into urine (D-penicillamine, trientine) or on agents preventing absorption of copper from food (zinc, ammonium-tetrahiomolybdene). Patients with asymptomatic Wilson's disease have to be treated as well. In Czech Republic either penicillamine or zinc are used.

WD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP7B, a protein localized to the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic copper excretion. Current treatment comprises reduction of circulating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatment, a significant number of patients have neurological deterioration. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that defects arising from some WD mutations are ameliorated by drug treatment aimed at improvement of protein folding and restoration of protein function. This necessitated systematic characterization of the molecular consequences of distinct ATP7B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p.S1363F, all mutations tested (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1343V, and p.S1363F) resulted in reduced ATP7B protein expression, whereas messenger RNA abundance was unaffected. Retention of mutant ATP7B in the endoplasmic reticulum, increased protein expression, and normalization of localization after culturing cells at 30 degrees C, and homology modeling suggested that these proteins were misfolded. Four distinct mutations exhibited residual copper export capacity, whereas other mutations resulted in complete disruption of copper export by ATP7B.

The ability to cycle between +1 and +2 oxidation state is one of the features that has been exploited by organisms throughout the evolutionary process. Since copper is potentially toxic to cells also a finely controlled mechanism for copper handling has evolved. On the other side, many copper complexes were synthesized and tested for their anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Their ability to kill cancer cells is mainly related to the induction of an oxidative stress, but recently it emerged their ability to inhibit the proteasome, a protein complex whose proteolitic activity is needed by several cellular process. It has generally been described that the toxic effects of copper complexes leads to cell death either by necrosis or through the activation of the apoptotic process. Evidences are rising about the ability of some copper compounds to induce alternative non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death. Since copper is indispensable for the formation of new blood vessels, angiogenesis, a different antitumor approach based on the administration of copper sequestering agents has been attempted and its effectiveness is currently under evaluation by clinical trials.

This hypothesis is based on in vitro studies demonstrating that metals (copper, zinc) accelerate the aggregation and precipitation into plaques of Abeta, ultimately leading to synaptic dysfunction and accelerated amyloidogenesis. Recently, we have identified in AD patients a specific 'copper disease' marker, consisting in a serum-increase of copper not bound to ceruloplasmin, named 'free' copper. Several patents have been issued in the recent years and many clinical trials have been attempted in search of an anti-metal effect counteracting AD progression. Some of them have delivered very encouraging results. These anti-metal agents, however, have also shown adverse events. This work is aimed at reviewing 'old' and 'new' attitudes towards the use of anti-copper complexing agents or biological molecules which induce or maintain a state of copper malabsorption, such as zinc compounds, paying special attention to how such a rethinking of 'old' clinical trials might trace new routes in planning 'modern' ones.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
19754369,Pharmacological therapies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.,"F J C Cuperus, A M Hafkamp, C V Hulzebos, H J Verkade","Severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, seen mainly in neonates, may cause kernicterus and death. Conventional treatment for severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia consists of phototherapy and exchange transfusion. Phototherapy, however, has several known disadvantages while exchange transfusion is associated with a significant morbidity, and even mortality. These harmful effects indicate the need to develop alternative pharmacological treatment strategies for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Generally, these strategies aim to decrease the plasma concentration of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) by inhibiting production, stimulating hepatic clearance, or interrupting the enterohepatic circulation of the pigment. To be considered for routine clinical use, an alternative treatment strategy should be less invasive and at least as effective and safe as phototherapy. Several pharmacological therapies such as metalloporhyrins, clofibrate, bile salts, laxatives and bilirubin oxidase may meet these criteria in the future, but none of them has yet been evaluated sufficiently to allow routine application. This review aims to discuss the state of the art and future perspectives in pharmacological treatment of neonatal jaundice.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
19931198,Drug development for orphan diseases in the context of personalized medicine.,George J Brewer,"Orphan diseases are diseases that are found in less than 200,000 patients in the United States, which is the cutoff point for the number of patients for a drug to be profitable. Because many thousands of orphan diseases exist in the aggregate (about 20 to 30 million Americans have orphan diseases), these patients are disenfranchised from drug development by the pharmaceutical industry. Orphan drugs are a large part of personalized medicine. The orphan diseases are often so rare that a physician may observe only 1 case a year or less. So proper treatment is a personalized encounter between doctor and patient. Academic physician-scientists have tried to fill this therapy vacuum by working on developing orphan drugs. But many disincentives are involved, which include career disincentives, lack of funding, and the multiple areas of expertise that are required. Positive developments include formation of the National Organization for Rare Diseases, the Orphan Drug Act, the development of a grant program to fund orphan drug development, the formation of the National Institutes of Health Office of Rare Diseases, and the passage of orphan drug legislation by other countries. Progress has increased, but the 300 orphan drugs and devices approved in the last 25 years are still only a drop in the bucket compared with the many thousands of orphan diseases. I believe we must do better. I present my own 2 examples of the positive and the negative aspects of orphan drug development, and I end this article by giving recommendations on how we might succeed both in developing more orphan drugs and in rescuing the pharmaceutical industry from its impending economic collapse.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
19936278,Metal chelators coupled with nanoparticles as potential therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease.,"Gang Liu, Ping Men, George Perry, Mark A Smith","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive and irreversible loss of memory followed by complete dementia. Despite the disease's high prevalence and great economic and social burden, an explicative etiology or viable cure is not available. Great effort has been made to better understand the disease's pathogenesis, and to develop more effective therapeutic agents. However, success is greatly hampered by the presence of the blood-brain barrier that limits a large number of potential therapeutics from entering the brain. Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is one of the few valuable tools for overcoming this impediment and its application as a potential AD treatment shows promise. In this review, the current studies on nanoparticle delivery of chelation agents as possible therapeutics for AD are discussed because several metals are found excessive in the AD brain and may play a role in the disease development. Specifically, a novel approach involving transport of iron chelation agents into and out of the brain by nanoparticles is highlighted. This approach may provide a safer and more effective means of simultaneously reducing several toxic metals in the AD brain. It may also provide insights into the mechanisms of AD pathophysiology, and prove useful in treating other iron-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Hallervorden-Spatz Syndrome. It is important to note that the use of nanoparticle-mediated transport to facilitate toxicant excretion from diseased sites in the body may advance nanoparticle technology, which is currently focused on targeted drug delivery for disease prevention and treatment. The application of nanoparticle-mediated drug transport in the treatment of AD is at its very early stages of development and, therefore, more studies are warranted.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

They may be associated with endocrine dysfunction, the most frequent of them being disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (hypoglycemia, diabetes). The endocrinologist might be led to screen these complications in a patient whose diagnosis has been done during childhood. In some rare cases, he should evoke the diagnosis in front of an endocrine disorder most often associated to a multisystemic involvement. This spreading field is new, not yet very well known in adulthood. Long-term consequences of IEM on fertility and bone metabolism are still poorly understood. Diagnosis orientation relies on a few specific lab investigations encompassing blood lactate, free fatty acids and 3-hydroxy-butyrate, ammoniemia, carnitine and acylcarnitines, aminoacid and urinary organic chromatography. Hyperinsulinism, glycogenosis, fatty acid ss-oxydation, carnitine cycle and glycosylation (CDG syndrome) disorders, fructose intolerance, tyrosinemia, organic aciduria may explain hypoglycemia. These diagnosis should be evoked in front of unexplained adult hypoglycemia. Diabetes is related to iron overload, mitochondriopathy and thiamine sensitive diabetes. Clinical spectrum of some forms of IEM switch from hypoglycemia in childhood to diabetes in adulthood. Mitochondriopathies can be associated to all types of endocrine disorders, the most frequent being diabetes and dysthyroidism. Hypothyroidism is encountered in mitochondriopathies, cystinosis and primary hyperoxaluria. Hypogonadism is almost constant in galactosemia, frequent in CDG syndromes, cystinosis and iron overload. Most of the time, a specialized advice is required, which is one of the mission of reference centres.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The proximate mechanisms responsible for neurodegeneration are unknown. Copper ions may play a role in Huntington disease by promoting oligomerization of expanded polyglutamine repeat protein fragments. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is a copper complexing agent with demonstrated tolerability and efficacy in another neurodegenerative disorder, Wilson disease. We evaluated ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in the R6/2 transgenic mouse model of Huntington disease. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate treatment delayed the onset of motor dysfunction in R6/2 mice. There was a trend towards reduced striatal degeneration, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate in this model. Given its known tolerability in humans with neurodegeneration, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate could be considered as a candidate for clinical trials in Huntington disease.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Tremendous advances have been made in uncovering the genetic basis of dystonia, including discovery of a gene causing early onset primary torsion dystonia-a GAG deletion in exon 5 of the DYT1 gene that encodes torsinA. Although the exact function of torsinA remains elusive, evidence suggests aberrant localization and interaction of mutated protein; this may result in an abnormal response to stress or interference with cytoskeletal events and the development of neuronal brain pathways. Breakthroughs include the discovery of a genetic modifier that protects against clinical expression in DYT1 dystonia and the identification of the gene causing DYT6, THAP1. The authors review genetic etiologies and discuss phenotypes as well as counseling of patients regarding prognosis and progression of the disease. They also address pharmacologic and surgical treatment options for various forms of dystonia.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

19574022,[Fulminant and subfulminant hepatitis: causes and treatment].,"Philippe Ichaï, Faouzi Saliba","Fulminant hepatitis is an emergency because within a few hours, the physician must find the cause of the hepatitis (not identified in 15 to 20% of cases), rule out any contraindication to liver transplantation, verify that it is indicated, and prevent and/or treat the complications associated with liver failure. Viruses (especially hepatitis viruses A and B), drugs, and toxic agents are the most common causes of fulminant hepatitis, with the proportions varying between countries. Hepatitis viruses, the leading cause through 1995-1996, have fallen behind drugs and in particular paracetamol, which is now the leading cause of this disease in Europe and in the United States. There are also other rarer causes: other viruses (e.g., herpes virus HSV1 or 2, hepatitis virus E, parvovirus B19, and chickenpox-herpes zoster), Wilson Disease, acute Budd-Chiari and Reyes syndromes, autoimmune hepatitis, neoplastic infiltration of the liver, hypoxic hepatitis, heatstroke, acute pregnancy-related steatosis, and the HELLP syndrome. Prognosis is essentially determined by neurological status, but is also affected very rapidly by damage to other organs. Liver transplantation has revolutionized the prognosis of fulminant hepatitis, causing survival to increase from 10-20% (all causes combined) to 75-80% at 1 year and 70% at 5 years.

Because metallothionein (MT) is the major Cu-binding protein in tx mouse liver and Cu-MT can enhance lipid peroxidation initiated by an organic hydroperoxide, the potential genotoxicity of Cu-MT in tx mice was assessed in male tx mice (11 to 12 months old) and in age- and sex-matched control wild-type (DL) mice. Toxic milk mutant mice, but not control DL mice, developed regenerative liver nodules (tx-N) with normal histologic appearance. Residual, non-nodular tx mouse liver (tx-R) was microscopically abnormal with large, atypical hepatocytes. The levels of Cu, zinc (Zn), and MT, and the numbers of apoptotic cells (APC) in tx-N, tx-R, and DL livers were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, 109cadmium-heme assay, and the TUNEL method, respectively. Significantly higher levels of MT, Cu, and Zn, as well as increased numbers of APC were found in both tx-N and tx-R compared with DL mouse livers. Intense nuclear and cytoplasmic immunohistochemical staining for MT was observed in both normal and atypical hepatocytes of the tx mouse, whereas only cytoplasmic staining for MT was detected in DL mouse liver tissue. Accumulated Cu could be detected in tx-R and tx-N liver by rhodanine staining but was not detected in other tx mouse organs, or in mouse liver or other organs of DL. The number of APC and level of MT were significantly higher in tx-R liver compared with both tx-N and DL liver. These results suggest that: (a) aged tx mouse accumulate excess Cu in liver accompanied by striking morphologic changes, and (b) although MT binds to Cu in tx mouse liver, the presence of high Cu-MT and Cu in the nucleus can be genotoxic and may lead to enhanced apoptosis.",1998,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In this paper we report about 52 children, who were treated with D-penicillamine. The biggest group presented chronic liver diseases in 24 patients and rheumaoid arthritis in 21 patients. The therapy was carried out for a longer time, in some cases over years. The dose varied from 15 to 35 mg/kg of body weight. The number of side-effects was lower in children than in adults. They were more frequent in the group of collagenoses than in the group of liver diseases. Whether later on liver damages will occur is not predictable by the pediatrician. The results were excellent for the chronic active hepatitis; we can recommend D-penicillamine for such affections. Also for the rheumatoid arthritis we could partially obtain good successes, but not as convincing as in liver-diseases.",1979,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

These changes occurred during a 14-year period in which he used oral zinc sulphate (three times daily 200 mg) as the only medication to influence copper metabolism. Before starting this long-term zinc sulphate therapy he had used D-penicillamine (three times daily 300 mg) for only 6 weeks. The antagonistic action of zinc sulphate on copper resorption with amelioration of the clinical condition has been described before in this patient in 1961 by Schouwink. The patient had used at that time oral zinc sulphate for approximately 1.5 years. No changes in Kayser-Fleischer rings and ceruloplasmin levels were mentioned. Our findings suggest that oral zinc sulphate may not only prevent storage of copper in the tissues but may also contribute to the mobilization and excretion of deposits of copper.",1979,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The dose-response curve was not shifted by indomethacin, imidazole, or PGE2 but was moved to the right by 2.8 X 10(-11) M PGE1 and to the left by 2.8 X 10(-7) M PGE1. These effects of copper are similar to the effects of PGI2 in the preparation. Copper moved the PGI2 dose-response curve against noradrenaline in parallel to the left, suggesting that the two were interacting at some point. Penicillamine, which may stimulate PGE1 synthesis, had PGE1-like interactions with the copper effect, suggesting that its value in Wilson's disease may be partly due to antagonism of the biological action of copper as well as to its copper-chelating properties.",1979,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The liver mainly plays a crucial role in maintaining systemic Zn homeostasis. Therefore, the occurrence of chronic liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or fatty liver, results in the impairment of Zn metabolism, and subsequently Zn deficiency. Zn deficiency causes plenty of metabolic abnormalities, including insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis and hepatic encephalopathy. Inversely, metabolic abnormalities like hypoalbuminemia in patients with liver cirrhosis often result in Zn deficiency. Recent studies have revealed the putative mechanisms by which Zn deficiency evokes a variety of metabolic abnormalities in chronic liver disease. Zn supplementation has shown beneficial effects on such metabolic abnormalities in experimental models and actual patients with chronic liver disease. This review summarizes the pathogenesis of metabolic abnormalities deriving from Zn deficiency and the favorable effects of Zn administration in patients with chronic liver disease.

The limitations of the currently available therapy for WD (particularly in the management of neuropsychiatric disease), together with our limited understanding of key aspects of this illness (e.g. neurological vs. hepatic presentation) justify the ongoing need to study WD in suitable animal models. Four animal models of WD have been established: the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat, the toxic-milk mouse, the Atp7b knockout mouse and the Labrador retriever. The existing models of WD all show good similarity to human hepatic WD and have been helpful in developing an improved understanding of the human disease. As mammals, the mouse, rat and canine models also benefit from high homology to the human genome. However, important differences exist between these mammalian models and human disease, particularly the absence of a convincing neurological phenotype.

Mutations in copper metabolism genes or abnormalities in copper metabolism result in disease from copper excess or deficiency. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase. Over 500 different WD mutations throughout the ATP7B gene have been described, most of which are missense mutations. Mutations in both ATP7B alleles result in abnormal copper metabolism and subsequent toxic accumulation of copper. The clinical manifestations of neurologic WD include variable combinations of dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, and choreoathetosis. Misdiagnosis and delay in treatment are clinically relevant because untreated WD progresses to hepatic failure or severe neurologic disability and death. Treatment can prevent and cure WD. Mutations in a second, closely related copper-transporting ATPase, ATP7A, cause a spectrum of copper deficiency disorders that include Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy.

Their focus was on the hepatic aspects of the disease. Recently, a position paper on pediatric WD was published by the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition. A need was felt to harmonize guidelines for the hepatic, pediatric, and neurological aspects of the disease and contextualize them to the resource-constrained settings. Therefore, experts from national societies from India representing 3 disciplines, hepatology (Indian National Association for Study of the Liver), pediatric hepatology (Indian Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition), and neurology (Movement Disorders Society of India) got together to evolve fresh guidelines. A literature search on retrospective and prospective studies of WD using MEDLINE (PubMed) was performed. Members voted on each recommendation, using the nominal voting technique. The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system was used to determine the quality of evidence. Questions related to diagnostic tests, scoring system, and its modification to a version suitable for resource-constrained settings were posed. While ceruloplasmin and 24-h urine copper continue to be important, there is little role of serum copper and penicillamine challenge test in the diagnostic algorithm. A new scoring system - Modified Leipzig score has been suggested with extra points being added for family history and serum ceruloplasmin lower than 5 mg/dl. Liver dry copper estimation and penicillamine challenge test have been removed from the scoring system. Differences in pharmacological approach to neurological and hepatic disease and global monitoring scales have been included. Rising bilirubin and worsening encephalopathy are suggested as indicators predicting need for liver transplant but need to be validated.

The therapeutic approach in WD patients is the generation of a negative copper balance and the maintenance of copper homeostasis, currently by the use of copper chelators such as D-penicillamine (D-PA). However, in circumstances of delayed diagnosis, poor treatment compliance, or treatment failure, mortality is almost certain without hepatic transplantation. Moreover, even after years of D-PA treatment, high liver copper levels are present in WD patients. We have recently suggested the use of the bacterial peptide Methanobactin (MB), which has an outstanding binding affinity for copper, as potentially efficient and patient-friendly remedy against copper damage in WD. Here we substantiate these findings considerably, by demonstrating a significant removal of copper from liver samples of WD rats upon short, one week only, MB treatments. Using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry with a spatial resolution down to 4 μm, we demonstrate that only small copper hotspots remain in MB treated animal livers. We further demonstrate in WD rat liver, seven weeks after the stopped MB treatment, a lower liver copper concentration as compared to untreated control animals.

Excess copper inhibits S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine hydrolase, leading to variable WD phenotypes from widespread alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression. Previously, we demonstrated that maternal choline supplementation in the Jackson toxic milk (tx-j) mouse model of WD corrected higher thioredoxin 1 (TNX1) transcript levels in fetal liver. Here, we investigated the effect of maternal choline supplementation on genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in tx-j fetal liver by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Tx-j Atp7b genotype-dependent differences in DNA methylation were corrected by choline for genes including, but not exclusive to, oxidative stress pathways. To examine phenotypic effects of postnatal choline supplementation, tx-j mice were randomized to one of six treatment groups: with or without maternal and/or continued choline supplementation, and with or without copper chelation with penicillamine (PCA) treatment. Hepatic transcript levels of TXN1 and peroxiredoxin 1 (Prdx1) were significantly higher in mice receiving maternal and continued choline with or without PCA treatment compared to untreated mice. A WGBS comparison of human WD liver and tx-j mouse liver demonstrated a significant overlap of differentially methylated genes associated with ATP7B deficiency. Further, eight genes in the thioredoxin (TXN) pathway were differentially methylated in human WD liver samples. In summary, Atp7b deficiency and choline supplementation have a genome-wide impact, including on TXN system-related genes, in tx-j mice. These findings could explain the variability of WD phenotype and suggest new complementary treatment options for WD.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
30469420,Trace Element Provision in Parenteral Nutrition in Children: One Size Does Not Fit All.,"Boutaina Zemrani, Zoe McCallum, Julie E Bines","Routine administration of trace elements is recognised as a standard of care in children requiring parenteral nutrition. However, there is a lack of global consensus regarding trace elements provision and dosing in pediatric parenteral nutrition. This review provides an overview of available evidence regarding trace elements supply and posology in parenteral nutrition in neonates and children. Trace elements provision in children should be tailored to the weight and clinical condition of the child with emphasis on those at risk of toxicity or deficiency. Based on current evidence, there is a need to review the formulation of commercial solutions that contain multiple-trace elements and to enable individual trace elements additives to be available for specific indications. Literature supports the removal of chromium provision whereas manganese and molybdenum supplementation are debated. Preterm neonates may have higher parenteral requirements in iodine, selenium and copper than previously recommended. There is growing support for the routine provision of iron in long-term parenteral nutrition.

WD patients with a NWIS > 11 should receive LT; however, we encountered 2 WD patients with an NWIS > 11 who recovered from ALF without LT. The present report aimed to analyze cases of WD patients with a high NWIS who recovered from severe ALF and to discuss the clinical manifestations of the patients and the effects of treatments, including zinc (Zn) therapy, chelator therapy, PE, CHDF, and LT. We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of five patients (male, 2; female, 3) diagnosed with WD along with severe ALF. In cases 1, 2, and 3, complete recovery from ALF was noted without LT. In case 4, initial recovery from ALF was noted without LT; however, ALF worsened owing to bleeding from the esophageal varix. Thus, the patient eventually needed LT. In case 5, recovery from ALF was noted with LT. All cases, except case 2, showed ALF with maximum PELD/MELD scores ≥26 and NWISs ≥ 11, and had indications for LT. In cases of severe ALF with grade I or II encephalopathy, we recommend evaluations of the effects of Zn and chelator treatments while preparing for LT, as the condition may not improve without LT, and pediatricians or physicians can ask transplant surgeons to perform LT urgently if required.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
30384011,Chelating principles in Menkes and Wilson diseases: Choosing the right compounds in the right combinations at the right time.,"Nina Horn, Lisbeth Birk Møller, Valeria Marina Nurchi, Jan Aaseth","Dysregulation of copper homeostasis in humans is primarily found in two genetic diseases of copper transport, Menkes and Wilson diseases, which show symptoms of copper deficiency or overload, respectively. However, both diseases are copper storage disorders despite completely opposite clinical pictures. Clinically, Menkes disease is characterized by copper deficiency secondary to poor loading of copper-requiring enzymes although sufficient body copper. Copper accumulates in non-hepatic tissues, but is deficient in blood, liver, and brain. In contrast, Wilson disease is characterized by symptoms of copper toxicity secondary to accumulation of copper in several organs most notably brain and liver, and a saturated blood copper pool. It is a challenge to correct copper dyshomeostasis in either disease though copper depletion in Menkes disease is most challenging. Both diseases are caused by defective copper export from distinct cells, and we seek to give new angles and guidelines to improve treatment of these two complementary diseases. Therapy of Menkes disease with copper-histidine, thiocarbamate, nitrilotriacetate or lipoic acid is discussed. In Wilson disease combination of a hydrophilic chelator e.g. trientine or dimercaptosuccinate with a brain shuttle e.g. thiomolybdate or lipoate, is discussed.

30277246,Altered zinc balance in the Atp7b,"Kelsey A Meacham, María Paz Cortés, Eve M Wiggins, Alejandro Maass, Mauricio Latorre, Martina Ralle, Jason L Burkhead","Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation in the ATP7B gene that affects copper transport in the body. ATP7B mutation damages copper transporter function, ultimately resulting in excessive copper accumulation and subsequent toxicity in both the liver and brain. Mechanisms of copper toxicity, however, are not well defined. The Atp7b-/- mouse model is well-characterized and presents a hepatic phenotype consistent with WD. In this study, we found that the untreated Atp7b-/- mice accumulate approximately 2-fold excess hepatic zinc compared to the wild type. We used targeted transcriptomics and proteomics to analyze the molecular events associated with zinc and copper accumulation in the Atp7b-/- mouse liver. Altered gene expression of Zip5 and ZnT1 zinc transporters indicated a transcriptional homeostatic response, while increased copper/zinc ratios associated with high levels of metallothioneins 1 and 2, indicated altered Zn availability in cells. These data suggest that copper toxicity in Wilson disease includes effects on zinc-dependent proteins. Transcriptional network analysis of RNA-seq data reveals an interconnected network of transcriptional activators with over-representation of zinc-dependent and zinc-responsive transcription factors. In the context of previous research, these observations support the hypothesis that mechanisms of copper toxicity include disruption of intracellular zinc distribution in liver cells. The translational significance of this work lies in oral zinc supplementation in treatment for WD, which is thought to mediate protective effects through the induction of metallothionein synthesis in the intestine. This work indicates broader impacts of altered zinc-copper balance in WD, including global transcriptional responses and altered zinc balance in the liver.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

29235558,Dietary copper restriction in Wilson's disease.,"Kylie Russell, Lyn K Gillanders, David W Orr, Lindsay D Plank","Dietary copper restriction has long been considered an important aspect of treatment for Wilson's disease (WD). However, evidence supporting this approach is limited. There are no published randomised controlled trials examining this recommendation due to rarity of the disease and variable presentation. This review summarises current knowledge on the absorption and regulation of copper in humans and its relevance to patients with WD. Studies have demonstrated that as the level of dietary copper increases, the proportion absorbed decreases. This observation implies that 'high copper' foods that WD patients are generally advised to avoid would need to be consumed in large amounts to impact markedly on the quantity absorbed. Dietary copper restriction is unlikely to reduce the amount absorbed significantly and is not only difficult to manage but restricts food groups unnecessarily, detracting from the provision of substrates essential for improving nutritional status in a nutritionally compromised group. Medical management for WD is effective in compliant patients, allowing stabilisation of the liver disease. Based on current evidence, dietary copper restrictions in stable WD patients who are adherent to medical therapy are unnecessary with two food exceptions (shellfish and liver).",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
30249412,The hidden face of Wilson's disease.,"F Woimant, N Djebrani-Oussedik, C Collet, N Girardot, A Poujois","In brief, the classic form of Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal-recessive condition with hepatic, neurologic, psychiatric and systemic manifestations. However, the diagnosis should not be excluded because of a family history consistent with autosomal-dominant transmission. The latest next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies have demonstrated a gap between phenotype and genetic prevalences, and also suggest that WD may still be underdiagnosed. In a majority of WD patients, early recognition and appropriate treatment can result in resolution of symptoms and/or improved quality of life. Thus, finding WD in patients aged>40 years or with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, unexplained bone pain, amenorrhea, repeated spontaneous abortion or renal lithiasis is of major importance. These symptoms can all be found on their own or in association with mild-to-incapacitating neurological and/or neuropsychiatric manifestations. While brain lesions of the lenticular, midbrain and dentate nuclei are classic, white-matter changes and cortical lesions may also be observed: these are often asymmetrical with frontal lobe predilection and, when extensive, associated with a poor prognosis. These lesions are due mainly to copper deposition, but may also be related to focal accumulation of other metals, such as iron and manganese. A new biological marker called 'relative exchangeable copper' (REC) facilitates diagnosis and familial screening. Patient monitoring is important to ensure treatment adherence, efficacy and tolerability, and to detect rare complications such as copper deficiency induced by chronic copper chelation and hepatocarcinoma in patients with cirrhosis. Currently used treatments are copper chelators and zinc salts. Therapeutic perspectives are liver transplantation, new copper chelators as tetrathiomolybdate, hepatocyte/tissue transfer and gene therapy.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The liver showed severe cirrhotic changes with macronodular pseudolobule formation, but there was little difference in immunohistochemical expression patterns of the copper transporter ATP7B between the control and present case. In the brain, there were both WD-related lesions such as the scattering of Opalski cells and changes caused by hepatic encephalopathy including the appearance of Alzheimer type II glia. Of note, we identified copper deposits in the systemic organs, including hepatocytes, renal tubules, and in broad areas of the brain. Surprisingly, as a result of further pursuit, copper accumulation in the brain was rarely identified in neuronal cells, but in Olig2-positive glial cells with double immunohistochemical staining. Together, this rare autopsied case suggests a novel cellular candidate affected by abnormal copper metabolism and the necessity to perform the systemic examination of copper deposition in WD.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In more common conditions, however, exome sequencing for diagnostic purposes remains the exception. Here we describe a patient initially diagnosed with a common, complex liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), who was determined to have Wilson disease (WD) upon research-related exome sequencing. The patient presented as a 14.5-yr-old adolescent with chronically elevated aminotransferases, normal ceruloplasmin, and histologic examination consistent with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis. He was enrolled in a large longitudinal study of patients with NAFLD and was found to have WD by exome sequencing performed 4 yr later. This new diagnosis, confirmed clinically by 24 h urine copper quantification, led to a change in the therapy from lifestyle counseling to directed treatment with d-penicillamine, a copper chelating agent. In this case, the likelihood of making the correct diagnosis and thereby choosing the appropriate treatment was increased by exome sequencing and careful interpretation. This example illustrates the utility of exome sequencing diagnostically in more common conditions not currently considered as targets for genome-wide evaluation and adds to a growing body of evidence that patients diagnosed with more common conditions often in fact have rarer genetically determined syndromes that have escaped clinical detection.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Clinical symptoms vary widely, from asymptomatic disease to acute liver failure or chronic liver disease with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. Continuation of specific medical treatment for WD is recommended during pregnancy, but reports of pregnancy outcomes in WD patients are sparse. In a retrospective, multicenter study, 282 pregnancies in 136 WD patients were reviewed. Age at disease onset, age at conception, and WD-specific treatments were recorded. Maternal complications during pregnancy, rate of spontaneous abortions, and birth defects were analyzed with respect to medical treatment during pregnancy. Worsening of liver function tests was evident during 16 of 282 (6%) pregnancies and occurred in undiagnosed patients as well as in those under medical treatment. Liver test abnormalities resolved in all cases after delivery. Aggravation of neurological symptoms during pregnancy was rare (1%), but tended to persist after delivery. The overall spontaneous abortion rate in the study cohort was 73 of 282 (26%).

The initial 1837 report of manganese-induced neurologic injury was made by John Couper, a university-based physician in Scotland. He made clear that the outbreak occurred among workers at the Charles Tennant bleach manufactory in the environs of Glasgow. The relatively new technology of chlorine generation using manganese accounted for the novel exposure involved. At the time, this factory was the largest hypochlorite bleaching powder producer in the world. As the 19th century progressed, technological change in steel fabrication requiring higher manganese content greatly increased demand for the metal. Nonetheless, more than six decades elapsed before the next reports of manganese neurotoxicity emerged. Two unrelated outbreaks (both on Continental Europe) were reported within weeks of each other in 1901, one by von Jaksch and the other by Embden. All the cases were heavily exposed to manganese-containing dust. By the eve of the First World War, a total of 9 patients with manganese-caused neurologic illness had been reported in five separate Continental European publications. Meanwhile, new technology led to another exposure source. Magnetic separation techniques allowed the extraction of zinc from mixed ore also containing iron and manganese, leading to exploitation of a unique source of high manganese-content ore found in New Jersey. Not long after that technology's introduction, in 1912 Casamajor reported the first U.S. cases of manganism, detailing classic findings. Additional cases from the same cohort were reported a few years later, with continued exposure driven by First World War-driven demand for manganese to be used in armaments. The nosology of chronic manganese neurotoxicity remained in flux, with considerable emphasis on shared attributes with Wilson's disease, a syndrome only then recently described. A landmark 1924 primate study by Mella showed manganese-induced basal ganglion damage; human autopsy study data in the years following further supported the view that manganese toxicity represented a parkinsonian syndrome. As the 1937 centenary of Couper's first report approached, newer technologies (electric arc welding and battery making) were being linked to manganese-caused disease, even as mineral extraction was expanding as a global source of exposure.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

A two-stage surgical plan was designed, and one domino graft was implanted during each stage. During the first stage, an auxiliary domino liver transplantation was conducted using a domino graft from a 4-year-old female child with Wilson's disease. After removing the right lobe of the FAP patient's liver, the graft was rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise and placed along the right side of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The orifices of the left, middle, and right hepatic veins were reconstructed using an iliac vein patch and then anastomosed to the right side of the IVC.

28203609,Zeb2: Inhibiting the inhibitors in Schwann cells.,"Bastian G Brinkmann, Susanne Quintes","Development of Schwann cells is tightly regulated by concerted action of activating and inhibiting factors. Most of the regulatory feedback loops identified to date are transcriptional activators promoting induction of genes coding for integral myelin proteins and lipids. The mechanisms by which inhibitory factors are silenced during Schwann cell maturation are less well understood. We could recently show a pivotal function for the transcription factor zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2) during Schwann cell development and myelination as a transcriptional repressor of maturation inhibitors. Zeb2 belongs to a family of highly conserved 2-handed zinc-finger proteins and represses gene transcription by binding to E-box sequences in the regulatory region of target genes. The protein is known to repress E-cadherin during epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor malignancy and mediates its functions by interacting with multiple co-factors. During nervous system development, Zeb2 is expressed in neural crest cells, the precursors of Schwann cells, the myelinating glial cells of peripheral nerves. Schwann cells lacking Zeb2 fail to fully differentiate and are unable to sort and myelinate peripheral nerve axons. The maturation inhibitors Sox2, Ednrb and Hey2 emerge as targets for Zeb2-mediated transcriptional repression and show persistent aberrant expression in Zeb2-deficient Schwann cells. While dispensible for adult Schwann cells, re-activation of Zeb2 is essential after nerve injury to allow remyelination and functional recovery. In summary, Zeb2 emerges as an ""inhibitor of inhibitors,"" a novel concept in Schwann cell development and nerve repair.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Although the transcriptional regulation of ZEB2 is essential for CNS development, the elements that regulate ZEB2 expression have yet to be identified. Here, we identified a proximal regulatory region of ZEB2 and characterized transcriptional enhancers during neuronal development. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing for active (H3K27ac) and repressed (H3K27me3) chromatin regions in human neuronal progenitors, combined with an in vivo zebrafish enhancer assay, we functionally characterized 18 candidate enhancers in the ZEB2 locus. Eight enhancers drove expression patterns that were specific to distinct mid/hindbrain regions (ZEB2#e3 and 5), trigeminal-like ganglia (ZEB2#e6 and 7), notochord (ZEB2#e2, 4 and 12) and whole brain (ZEB2#e14). We further dissected the minimal sequences that drive enhancer-specific activity in the mid/hindbrain and notochord. Using a reporter assay in human cells, we showed an increased activity of the minimal notochord enhancer ZEB2#e2 in response to AP-1 and DLX1/2 expressions, while repressed activity of this enhancer was seen in response to ZEB2 and TFAP2 expressions. We showed that Dlx1 but not Zeb2 and Tfap2 occupies Zeb2#e2 enhancer sequence in the mouse notochord at embryonic day 11.5. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we deleted the ZEB2#e2 region, leading to reduction of ZEB2 expression in human cells. We thus characterized distal transcriptional enhancers and trans-acting elements that govern regulation of ZEB2 expression during neuronal development. These findings pave the path toward future analysis of the role of ZEB2 regulatory elements in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Mowat-Wilson syndrome.",2019,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

However, cases of Immunoglobulin A nephropathy secondary to Wilson's disease are very rare. A 20-year-old Japanese man presented with microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. A renal biopsy showed mesangial cell proliferation, immunoglobulin A deposition, and electron-dense deposit in the mesangial areas, all of which are consistent with Immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed liver atrophy and splenomegaly, and the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed with decreased serum ceruloplasmin levels, increased urinary copper excretion, Kayser-Fleischer rings and copper deposition in the liver biopsy. The patient was treated successfully with trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate and showed improvement in renal manifestations. Wilson's disease is a rare cause of secondary Immunoglobulin A nephropathy. We recommend that Wilson's disease should be considered the cause of secondary Immunoglobulin A nephropathy in juvenile patients with hematuria, proteinuria, and splenomegaly and suggest measuring the serum ceruloplasmin concentrations, urinary copper excretion, and evaluating Kayser-Fleischer rings in these patients.",2019,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
30468117,[Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration].,"Bernd Mensing, Albina Nowak, Sandrine Zweifel, Luigi Terracciano, Christine Bernsmeier, Magdalena Filipowicz Sinnreich","Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration Abstract. Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The most common clinical presentations are liver disease and / or neuro-psychiatric manifestations. Pathophysiologically, Wilson's disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which lead to defective biliary excretion of copper and subsequent accumulation of copper in the liver and in other organs. Its prevalence is approximately 1:30 000, however its penetrance, clinical presentation and disease severity vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to cirrhosis or acute liver failure with or without neuro-psychiatric symptoms. For this reason, Wilson's disease should be suspected and ruled out in cases of indeterminate liver disease or neuropsychiatric disturbances. The diagnostic algorithms are complex and involve clinical tests, ophthalmologic examination (Kayser-Fleischer rings in split-lamp examination), blood and urine tests, genetic testing, imaging and histology. In compensated liver disease, treatment of Wilson's disease by copper depletion (chelators, zinc) is usually effective. In case of liver failure liver transplantation may be needed, which corrects the underlying error of copper metabolism. New drugs with improved efficacy and tolerability are in clinical development.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
29394035,Copper Complexes in Cancer Therapy.,"Delphine Denoyer, Sharnel A S Clatworthy, Michael A Cater","Copper homeostasis is tightly regulated in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells to ensure sufficient amounts for cuproprotein biosynthesis, while limiting oxidative stress production and toxicity. Over the last century, copper complexes have been developed as antimicrobials and for treating diseases involving copper dyshomeostasis (e.g., Wilson's disease). There now exists a repertoire of copper complexes that can regulate bodily copper through a myriad of mechanisms. Furthermore, many copper complexes are now being appraised for a variety of therapeutic indications (e.g., Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) that require a range of copper-related pharmacological affects. Cancer therapy is also drawing considerable attention since copper has been recognized as a limiting factor for multiple aspects of cancer progression including growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Consequently, 'old copper complexes' (e.g., tetrathiomolybdate and clioquinol) have been repurposed for cancer therapy and have demonstrated anticancer activity in vitro and in preclinical models. Likewise, new tailor-made copper complexes have been designed based on structural and biological features ideal for their anticancer activity. Human clinical trials continue to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of copper complexes as anticancer agents and considerable progress has been made in understanding their pharmacological requirements. In this chapter, we present a historical perspective on the main copper complexes that are currently being repurposed for cancer therapy and detail several of the more recently developed compounds that have emerged as promising anticancer agents. We further provide an overview of the known mechanisms of action, including molecular targets and we discuss associated clinical trials.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The DASH diet encompasses foods (e.g., fresh fruit, vegetables, and nuts) and antioxidant nutrients (e.g., vitamins A, C, E, and zinc) with potential benefits for persons with asthma, but it is unknown whether the whole diet is beneficial. Participants (n = 90) will be randomized to receive usual care alone or combined with a DASH intervention consisting of 8 group and 3 individual sessions during the first 3 months, followed by at least monthly phone consultations for another 3 months. Follow-up assessments will occur at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is the 7-item Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire, a validated composite measure of daytime and nocturnal symptoms, activity limitations, rescue medication use, and percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second. We will explore changes in inflammatory markers important to asthma pathophysiology (e.g., fractional exhaled nitric oxide) and their potential to mediate the intervention effect on disease control. We will also conduct pre-specified subgroup analyses by genotype (e.g., polymorphisms on the glutathione S transferase gene) and phenotype (e.g., atopy, obesity).

The purpose of this prospective, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to determine whether GCM reduced the frequency of vomiting, diarrhoea and appetite changes during initiation of ciclosporin (Atopica(®); Novartis Animal Health) therapy for the treatment of canine atopic dermatitis. Sixty privately owned dogs diagnosed with atopic dermatitis were randomly assigned to GCM (n=30) or placebo (n=30) groups. All dogs received ∼ 5 mg/kg ciclosporin (range, 3.5-5.8 mg/kg) once daily. Dogs <13.6 kg received half a tablet of GCM or placebo; dogs ≥ 13.6 kg received one tablet once daily. GastriCalm(®) or placebo was administered 30 min prior to eating, and the ciclosporin was administered 2 h after feeding. Owners recorded episodes of vomiting, diarrhoea and appetite changes.

WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate) is an investigational copper (Cu)-protein-binding agent developed for the treatment of Wilson disease (WD), a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B Cu-transporter and resulting in toxic Cu accumulation. 2. Mass balance of a single intravenous WTX101 dose, measured as molybdenum (Mo), was assessed over 168 h in control (Long Evans Agouti [LEA]) and Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats, a WD model. 3. In LEC rats, Mo was partially excreted (up to 45%); 29% by renal clearance, and faecal clearance, still ongoing at 168 h, accounted for 16%. In contrast, in LEA rats, Mo was almost fully excreted (∼87%); 79% was renally cleared with only 7% faecal excretion. 4. In LEC rats, the proportion of faecal to renal Mo excretion was enhanced (4:6) compared to controls (1:9). 5. Substantially more Mo was found in LEC liver and kidney compared with LEA tissues, in line with tissue Cu distribution. 6. These findings are consistent with the WTX101 mechanism of action: in the WD model, excess Cu is removed from hepatic metallothionein and retained within the stable tetrathiomolybdate-Cu-albumin tripartite complex, preventing tetrathiomolybdate degradation and resulting in less urinary elimination and greater faecal excretion than in controls.",2019,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Copper overload can be assessed as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper (NCC) in blood. Current therapies are limited by efficacy, safety concerns, and multiple-daily dosing. Areas covered: This article reviews the literature on WTX101 (bis-choline tetrathiomolybdate), an oral first-in-class copper-protein-binding agent in development for the treatment of WD. Expert opinion: In a proof-of-concept phase II trial, once-daily WTX101 over 24 weeks rapidly lowered NCC levels and this was accompanied by improved neurological status without apparent initial drug-induced paradoxical worsening, reduced disability, stable liver function, with a favorable safety profile. WTX101 directly removes excess copper from intracellular hepatic copper stores and also forms an inert tripartite complex with copper and albumin in the circulation and promotes biliary copper excretion. These mechanisms may explain the rapid biochemical and clinical improvements observed. A phase III trial of WTX101 is ongoing and results are eagerly awaited to confirm if WTX101 can improve the treatment of this devastating disease.",2018,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In Alzheimer's disease (AD), meta-analyses show that copper decreases in brain but increases in serum, due to the nCp Cu component increase. Despite the similarities, a direct comparison of copper biological status in the two diseases has never been carried out. To fill this gap, we evaluated serum copper, ceruloplasmin, nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp in 385 CE and 336 healthy controls previously investigated that were compared with 9 newly diagnosed WD patients. We then assessed 24h copper urinary excretion in 24 WD patients under D-penicillamine (D-pen) treatment and in 35 healthy controls, and compared results with those of AD patients participating to a D-pen phase II clinical trial previously published. After adjusting for sex and age, serum nCp-Cu and Cu:Cp resulted higher in AD and in WD than in healthy controls (both p<0.001). While nCp-Cu was similar between AD and WD, Cu:Cp was higher in WD (p<0.016). 24h urinary copper excretion in AD patients (12.05μg/day) was higher than in healthy controls (4.82μg/day; p<0.001). 77.8% of the AD patients under D-pen treatment had a 24h urinary excretion higher than 200μg/day, suggestive of a failure of copper control.

30002817,Recent advances in understanding liver fibrosis: bridging basic science and individualized treatment concepts.,"Ralf Weiskirchen, Sabine Weiskirchen, Frank Tacke","Hepatic fibrosis is characterized by the formation and deposition of excess fibrous connective tissue, leading to progressive architectural tissue remodeling. Irrespective of the underlying noxious trigger, tissue damage induces an inflammatory response involving the local vascular system and the immune system and a systemic mobilization of endocrine and neurological mediators, ultimately leading to the activation of matrix-producing cell populations. Genetic disorders, chronic viral infection, alcohol abuse, autoimmune attacks, metabolic disorders, cholestasis, alterations in bile acid composition or concentration, venous obstruction, and parasite infections are well-established factors that predispose one to hepatic fibrosis. In addition, excess fat and other lipotoxic mediators provoking endoplasmic reticulum stress, alteration of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and modifications in the microbiota are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and, subsequently, the initiation and progression of hepatic fibrosis. Multidisciplinary panels of experts have developed practice guidelines, including recommendations of preferred therapeutic approaches to a specific cause of hepatic disease, stage of fibrosis, or occurring co-morbidities associated with ongoing loss of hepatic function.

Wilson disease is treatable, primarily by copper-chelation therapy, which promotes copper excretion. Although several de-coppering drugs are currently available, their Cu(I)-binding affinities have not been quantitatively characterized. Here we determined the Cu(I)-binding affinities of five major de-coppering drugs - D-penicillamine, trientine, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinate and tetrathiomolybdate - by exploring their ability to extract Cu(I) ions from two Cu(I)-binding proteins, the copper chaperone for cytochrome c oxidase, Cox17, and metallothionein. We report that the Cu(I)-binding affinity of these drugs varies by four orders of magnitude and correlates positively with the number of sulfur atoms in the drug molecule and negatively with the number of atoms separating two SH groups. Based on the analysis of structure-activity relationship and determined Cu(I)-binding affinity, we hypothesize that the endogenous biologically active substance, α-lipoic acid, may be suitable for the treatment of Wilson disease. Our hypothesis is supported by cell culture experiments where α-lipoic acid protected hepatic cells from copper toxicity.

The following enzymatic activities were recorded: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), alkaline phosphatase (AP), acid phosphatase (AcP), and ""leucine aminopeptidase"" (LAP). A dose-dependent activation by D-penicillamine occurred in the case of G-6-PDH- and AcP-activities, a dose-dependent inhibition by D-penicillamine was found with AP- and GAPDH-activities. LDH- and LAP-activities remained unchanged in the presence of D-penicillamine in concentrations up to 10 mg/ml (67 mM/l). From the data of pharmacokinetic studies in rats it may be concluded that concentrations of D-penicillamine which influence enzymatic activities may easily be reached in vivo, under the conditions of treating rheumatoid arthritis and Morbus Wilson.

Special attention was paid to the copper kinetics during the first hour after injection of 64Cu. Two different measuring techniques were used simultaneously: one collimated NaI(Tl) crystal was in a fixed position over the liver, the counts being recorded by a single channel analyser connected to a multi-channel analyser in a multi-channel scaling mode; and a second collimated crystal makes scanning movements along the body axis, the counts being recorded by a multi-channel analyser in a multi-spectrum scaling mode. With this procedure it is possible to use a double nuclide labelling technique by means of which both the 64Cu values for an organ can be corrected for the 64Cu blood content in the region of interest, and information can be obtained on the actual dynamic 64Cu movement in the body.",1975,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Under penicillamine treatment, there was observed a tendency toward normalization of pathological conditions rather than deterioration of normal E.E.G. findings. So far as familial studies are concerned, the authors report the results obtained for 9 fathers, 19 mothers, and 24 siblings from a total of 21 kindreds; what is remarkable in this connection is the comparatively small percentage of normal E.E.G. findings for healthy siblings.

In family A, the largest kindred of this recessively inherited disease thus far reported, the proband presented with chronic active hepatitis, one sibling died of cirrhosis, a second had clinical evidence of chronic liver disease and two others had biochemical and histologic changes in liver biopsy specimens. In family B the proband had cirrhosis and portal hypertension and one sibling had biochemical and histologic evidence of liver disease. All six living patients had low serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin and copper and a high 24-hour urinary excretion of copper, which was greatly increased by administration of D-penicillamine. None showed neurologic abnormalities and only one had Kayser-Fleischer rings (detectable only by slit-lamp examination). Each patient had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 8 mm/h or less. After 3 and 2 years, respectively, of D-penicillamine therapy the conditions of the two probands had improved.

No patient was specifically included or excluded from the series because of the presence or absence of locomotor symptoms. The most common radiological abnormality was a generalized increase of radiolucency, interpreted as skeletal demineralization (21 cases), followed by premature osteoarthrosis (8 cases). Changes in the spine were common and included osteochondritis, reduction of intervertebral joint spaces, osteoarthrosis, and a tendency to squaring of vertebral bodies. Other bony changes included fluffy irregularity of femoral trochanters, osteochondritis dissecans of the knees, osteophytic protrusions at bone ends, and bunches of tongue-like osteophytes at joint margins. The symptoms associated with these radiological abnormalities comprised back pain and stiffness with restricted movement, pain and stiffness of knees, hips, and wrists, and tenderness to pressure over margins of affected joints.

It is associated with the classic triad of cirrhosis, neurological manifestations, and the ocular finding of Kayser-Fleischer rings; however, the clinical presentation can vary greatly from incidental findings of abnormal liver enzymes to acute liver failure necessitating liver transplant. Pediatric patients may present with subtle findings including asymptomatic hepatomegaly, transaminitis, changes in behavior, movement disorders, or school failure. The general pediatrician may be the first to recognize these symptoms and should consider Wilson's disease in their differential diagnosis. Wilson's disease can be managed with lifelong chelation or zinc therapy in patients who present early in the disease; therefore, pediatricians should have a low threshold for referral to a pediatric hepatologist for further evaluation when it is suspected.

Recently, TM has been found to enhance the therapeutic effect of cisplatin; however, the origin of this effect is not clear. Here we found that TM can inhibit the reaction of cisplatin with Cu-Atox1 and prevent the protein unfolding and aggregation induced by cisplatin. Although Ag(i) binds to Atox1 in a way similar to Cu(i)-Atox1, TM does not prevent the reaction of Ag-Atox1 with cisplatin. This result indicates that the formation of a Mo-centered trimeric protein cluster in the TM-Cu-Atox1 system plays a role in the inhibitory effect.

We are presenting the case of a man whose age at onset of the disease was 55 years and who had the hepatic complications of Wilson's disease without clinical evidence of disease of the central nervous system. All patients with chronic hepatitis (chronic active liver disease) or cirrhosis of unknown etiology should be screened for the possibility of Wilson's disease. This screening should include slit-lamp biomicroscopy for Kayser-Fleischer rings, determination of serum ceruloplasmin concentration, and measurement of 24-hour urinary excretion of copper.

241690,Molecular biology of copper. A circular dichroism study on copper complexes of thionein and penicillamine.,"H Rupp, W Voelter, U Weser","Chicken liver Cd, Zn-thionein (metallothionein) was isolated from Cd-pretreated chickens weighing 1 500 g. The native Cd, Zn-thionein contained 9 g-atoms of metals per 12 000 g of protein. Upon the addition of Cu(CH3CN)4ClO4, all Cd2 and Zn2 were successfully replaced. 15 g-atoms of Cu from the acetonitrile perchlorate complex were bound to the protein. Due to the absence of aromatic amino acid residues, thionein has unique ultraviolet and circular dichroism properties. The shoulder of the ultraviolet spectrum at 250 nm (A250 X A280(-1) = 23.9) was shifted to 275 nm (A250 X A280(-1) = 1.6). No significant absorption was detected in the visible region. Th conformational changes of the protein moiety were much more visible in the circular dichroism spectra. The titration with Cu(CH3CH)2 caused the appearence of three new Cotton effects: 257.5 nm (+), 350 nm (+) and 301 nm (-). The negative Cotton effect at 239 nm of the original metallothionein was completely levelled off. The binding strength of copper with thionein is extraordinarily high: it survives proton treatment up to pH 1.9. Displacement of the Cd2 by Cu employing Cd-thionein which was formed at pH 2.2 resulted in the same circular dichroism properties as observed for Cu-thionein. D-Penicillamine proved a suitable model for the metal-free thionein, since redox reactions and polymerization of the sterically hindered thiol residue are known to be slow. The correlation of the circular dichroism properties of either copper complex using thionein or D-penicillamine was surprisingly high. Circular dichroism measurements of Cu(I)-D-penicillamine revealed Cotton effects at 255 nm (+), 280 nm (+) and 355 nm (-). Upon examining the red-violet mixed Cu(-i)-cu(II)-D-penicillamine complex, Cotton bands in the visible region at 425 nm (-) and 495 nm (+) were seen. In many blue copper enzymes, the copper is assumed to be in the neighborhood of both cysteine and aromatic amino acid residues, which are known to play an important role in the electron transfer. This is not the case in the Cu-thionein, which would explain many different properties of this copper protein. It is very attractive to conclude that the sterically hindered SH-group of D-penicillamine reacts with excess copper in a specific way, similar to the Cu-thionein. This phenomenon could explain the considerable success of D-penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",1975,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

A brief review of the pertinent literature disclosed that the dermatologic lesions of pemphigus secondary to penicillamine are alleviated by discontinuation of penicillamine and institution of prednisone therapy. Our patient's primarily oral lesions did not resolve with this recommended alteration in therapy, since penicillamine could be discontinued only briefly in the interest of maintaining acceptable serum copper levels and because of the paucity of available alternative copper-chelating agents.

7308845,Hepatic copper in primary biliary cirrhosis: biliary excretion and response to penicillamine treatment.,"M P Salaspuro, P Pikkarainen, P Sipponen, E Vuori, T A Miettinen","Excessive hepatic copper accumulation occurs in long-lasting cholestatic liver disorders especially in primary biliary cirrhosis. As in Wilson's disease, penicillamine has recently been introduced for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis. In Wilson's disease there is decreased biliary excretion of copper. The present study shows that as compared with controls the biliary excretion of copper is not decreased in primary biliary cirrhosis; instead it may be increased in some patients. However, when compared with high hepatic copper concentration biliary copper excretion was low. In contrast with copper, biliary secretion of bile acids was decreased in eight of the 17 patients. Treatment with oral penicillamine (600 mg/day) for one year resulted in a significant decrease of hepatic copper concentration, but had no consistent effect on the biliary excretion of copper or on the amount of histologically stainable orcein-positive copper-binding protein. The results suggest that excessive hepatic copper accumulation in primary biliary cirrhosis may not be primarily caused by a decreased biliary excretion, or that a new equilibrium is achieved in advanced primary biliary cirrhosis. D-penicillamine appears to improve significantly the biliary excretion of bile acids.",1981,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We report high hepatic MT protein accumulation (greater than 100-fold compared with wild-type mice) in toxic milk (tx) mice, along with markedly higher cytosol copper and zinc levels. Increased MT-gene transcription alone could not account for the high constitutive MT protein levels, since MT mRNA levels were not increased in tx mouse livers. However, hepatic MT was significantly more stable in adult tx mice: MT half-life (t1/2) was 79 or 77% greater than in wild-type mice before and after Cd induction respectively. Cd or Zn treatment increased MT mRNA, but not MT protein, accumulation in tx mouse livers: Cd displaced MT-bound Zn and Cu in preexisting MT. Thus tx mice appear to accumulate hepatic MT as a result of decreased protein degradation.

Depending on the etiology of chronic liver disease, the function of the electron transport chain and/or ATP synthesis was found to be impaired, leading to decreased oxidative metabolism of various substrates and to impaired recovery of the hepatic energy state after a metabolic insult. Changes in mitochondrial structure include megamitochondria with reduced cristae, dilatation of mitochondrial cristae and crystalloid inclusions in the mitochondrial matrix.

The primary defect is localized in the liver and the disease is manifested by the accumulation of copper in tissues. The diminution of ceruloplasmin, which until a few years ago was mistakenly thought to be the pathogenetic cause of Wilson's disease, is an epiphenomenon of the underlying metabolic defect characterized by defective copper biliary excretion. There are four stages in the natural history of the disease: 1) an asymptomatic stage of hepatic copper accumulation; 2) dismission and redistribution of copper leading to hepatocellular necrosis and hemolysis; 3) extrahepatic accumulation of copper leading to the onset of cirrhosis and neurological damage; 4) stage of homeostasis following treatment but with possible irreversible neurological damage. Treatment of Wilson's disease takes the form of pharmacological, dietary and surgical therapy. Through the formation of copper and protein metal complexes D-penicillamine impoverishes copper deposits causing the reduction or disappearance of hepatic and neurological symptoms; a small percentage of patients treated develops a nephrotic syndrome requiring the compulsory suspension of the drug. In this case a valid alternative is triethylenetetramine dichlorohydrate (TETA) which provokes increased blood copper during copper diuresis. The response to pharmacological treatment is better the earlier treatment is started and the more regular its administration. Dietary intake of copper must be reduced in parallel avoiding foods with a high copper content. Liver transplant obviously leads to the ""resolution"" of the underlying metabolic problem in patients who develop fulminating hepatitis with hypercupremia and hemolysis and, of course, in cases of uncompensated cirrhosis which do not respond to chelating therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

On the other hand, ceruloplasmin (Cp) is synthesized in the liver and excreted into the blood plasma mostly as an apo-protein before the onset of acute hepatitis, and then holoform at the onset of jaundice. Thus, Cu is supplied differentially between Cp and SOD, and at different times, i.e., before and at the onset of acute hepatitis. Availability of Cu to apo-SOD was examined to explain the mechanisms for the differential supply of Cu among three different Cu forms; i) cuprous ion bound to glutathione, ii) free cupric ion, and iii) cuprous ion bound to MT. Cu was transferred to SOD from the three Cu complexes though MT-bound Cu was a less efficient Cu source to apo-SOD. The results indicate that SOD is always present in a holo-form in LEC rats because even MT-bound Cu can be supplied to SOD, while Cp is present in an apo-form because Cu is sequestered to MT and not available in free ionic forms in LEC rats before the onset of acute hepatitis.",1994,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

There was also a movement of copper to higher molecular weight proteins in both liver cytosol and bile. In contrast to penicillamine, tetrathiotungstate did not increase liver cytosolic apometallothionein levels and reduced the rise provoked by copper. Metallothionein-bound copper was removed. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was inhibited and there was evidence for increased movement of copper into subcellular organelles, probably lysosomes.

At higher dose levels (1.5 mg W) there was considerable hydrolysis immediately after injection with rapid excretion of label in urine. The [185W] tetrathiotungstate remaining in plasma was associated with albumin and the amount retained was increased by pretreatment of the rats with copper. The increased binding to albumin did not prevent hepatic uptake and over the short-term pretreatment with copper increased the movement of the isotope into subcellular organelles, probably lysosomes. The excretion in bile was increased and the label was associated with high molecular weight proteins. In liver cytosol the 185W was bound by specific, as yet uncharacterized, proteins. At the higher dose levels there was some movement to higher molecular weight proteins and this was greatly increased by the pretreatment with copper.

In liver metastasis of colorectal cancer, copper and zinc concentrations are usually decreased compared to normal liver tissue, but little is known about the concomitant metallothionein levels. In the present study metallothionein concentrations were determined in archival liver samples from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease, and in both normal and malignancy-containing liver samples from patients with metastasis from a colorectal adenocarcinoma. Twenty-seven control liver samples contained 3.98 +/- 1.55 mg metallothionein/g protein. From the 21 liver samples of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, which had a mean metallothionein concentration of 6.06 +/- 5.03 mg/g protein, 6 were above the highest control level. Liver metallothionein concentrations for the 8 patients with Wilson's disease were significantly elevated (10.98 +/- 6.93 mg/g protein, p < 0.005 vs. controls and p < 0.05 vs. primary biliary cirrhosis). In the 11 liver metastases from colorectal adenocarcinomas metallothionein concentrations (1.17 +/- 0.90 mg/g protein) were significantly (p < 0.005) lower than surrounding normal liver tissue (4.25 +/- 1.75 mg/g protein). We conclude that in primary biliary cirrhosis and Wilson's disease increased liver metallothionein concentrations may detoxify the accumulated copper. Furthermore, liver metastasis of colorectal cancer contains less metallothionein than the surrounding normal liver tissue.",1992,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Seventeen had Wilson's disease, 22 had autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, 6 had primary sclerosing cholangitis, 12 had chronic liver disease of various etiologies, 4 had cryptogenic acute liver failure, 6 had acute hepatitic illnesses and 8 had a variety of disorders featuring normal liver histological appearance. Serum ceruloplasmin and total copper levels were significantly lower in Wilson's disease patients compared with all other groups, but three children with Wilson's disease had normal ceruloplasmin levels and seven had normal total copper levels. No significant difference was found for free serum copper levels and liver copper content between Wilson's disease patients and the other groups. Baseline 24-hr urinary copper excretion was significantly higher in Wilson's disease patients compared with that of the other patients, but six children with Wilson's disease had levels just above the upper limit of normal, overlapping with values obtained in three children with liver failure, two with acute hepatitis, two with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and three with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The 24-hr urinary copper excretion after penicillamine challenge proved the most accurate single diagnostic test; levels more than 25 mumol/24 hr were present in 15 of 17 patients with Wilson's disease, but in only 1 child with liver failure of the 58 with other disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Because we found a corresponding gross copper accumulation in the liver of the rats, we examined whether the development of hepatitis in our rat system could be prevented by administration of D-penicillamine. D-Penicillamine is a copper-chelating agent and one of the drugs effective for human Wilson's disease, in which abnormal copper metabolism is also observed. The results show that D-penicillamine treatment inhibited the elevation of serum transaminases, suppressed abnormal histological changes in the liver and completely prevented the onset of hepatitis in the Long-Evans Cinnamon rats. We further found that the copper concentration in the liver and serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were decreased, whereas the urinary copper level was increased in the D-penicillamine-treated Long-Evans Cinnamon rats.

The prevalence rate was 0.6 per 100,000 individuals. Clinical onset was hepatic (50%) or neurologic (50%), but at diagnosis (6.4 years later) 67% of patients showed several clinical manifestations: hepatic, neurologic, renal and haematologic. Among the essential diagnostic indices we find false negative results for Kayser-Fleischer ring (25%), serum ceruloplasmin (8%) and total serum copper (34%). Ten patients were treated with penicillamine. This drug was effective and well tolerated, although one patient (10%) developed membranous nephritis and required to change successively to BAL and trien. In a 61 months follow-up 5 patients (42%) died from severe liver failure. Patients with poor prognosis had a diagnostic delay and a liver failure degree significantly greater than patients with good prognosis. Our results suggest the following conclusions: a) in Spain the prevalence rate of Wilson's disease is near the lower reported rate; b) the early diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rare; c) diagnosis should be made only when several essential indices are positive; d) early hepatic transplantation showed carried out in patients with acute or chronic severe liver failure.",1992,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and AST levels found in fulminant Wilson's disease were significantly different from those found in other cases of fulminant liver failure, but differentiation from other causes of fulminant liver failure on the basis of these biochemical parameters was not possible. The alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin and aspartate AST/bilirubin ratios derived from the above parameters were also significantly lower in fulminant Wilson's disease than in other categories of fulminant liver failure, but distinction between diagnostic categories on this basis was not possible. When ratios that correctly identified all cases of fulminant Wilson's disease were selected, 59/190 (31%) and 84/190 (44%) cases of non-Wilsonian fulminant liver failure would erroneously be assigned a diagnosis of fulminant Wilson's disease, by alkaline phosphatase/bilirubin and AST/bilirubin ratios, respectively. A low alkaline phosphatase-to-bilirubin ratio (< 0.57) in any category of fulminant liver failure suggested a significantly worse prognosis than in cases with higher ratios (chi 2, Yates' corrected = 5.37, p = 0.02). In the Wilson's disease group, serum and hepatic copper and ceruloplasmin concentrations were normal in 4/21, 2/15 and 2/19, respectively, whereas urinary copper level was elevated in 18/18 and was the most valuable test in diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1992,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In LEC rats, urinary excretion of trientine was remarkably lower than that of Wistar rats. The absorption rates from the jejunal loop and in vitro metabolism in the liver S9 fraction (supernatant of 9000 x g) were approximately the same for both strains. The decline of urinary excretion of trientine in LEC rats is thought to be due mainly to the lowering of the functional activity of the kidney, because urinary excretion of creatinine and phenolsulfonphthalein were significantly lower in LEC rats than those in Wistar rats. Both acceleration of urinary excretion of copper and reduction of hepatic copper levels were observed with treatment of trientine in LEC rats aged 6 weeks. In LEC rats aged 13 weeks, however, no de-coppering effect from the liver was observed, though urinary excretion of copper was increased.

In retrospect, the clinical picture was atypical, notably with an important neurologic involvement mainly parkinsonism almost uncontrollable and aggravated with neuroleptics. The chelating treatment with d-penicillamine resulted in partial improvement of the neurological involvement because the extrapyramidal and neurovegetative symptoms persisted. The psychiatric symptoms improved with fewer neuroleptics than during the 12 previous years. However, neuroleptics had to be continued because of the delay in diagnosing the illness, which diminished the efficiency of the single chelating treatment.

The LEC groups aged 7 and 13 weeks showed low concentrations of Cu in all regions compared to Long-Evans Agouti (LEA) rats. In 32-week-old LEC rats, however, Cu concentrations increased in 7 regions, in particular, significantly so in the striatum, hypothalamus, cerebellum, midbrain and cortex. Changes of Zn concentration were not found in any region. The Fe concentration increased in cortex and olfactory lobes. The three LEC groups showed a very high concentration of hepatic Cu and a low concentration of serum Cu compared to LEA rats. In LEC rats aged 32 weeks, however, hepatic Cu decreased and serum Cu increased compared to the other two LEC groups. These results suggest that the increase of the cerebral Cu concentration is closely related to the inherently abnormal Cu metabolism and then to the changes of Cu metabolism from about 13 weeks after birth.",1992,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

7846258,Hepatic disease and psychiatric illness: relationships and treatment.,"J Ananth, R Swartz, K Burgoyne, R Gadasally","A relationship between hepatic diseases and psychiatric symptoms has long been speculated. While liver detoxication makes the exogenous substances harmless for the body, there are occasions where the liver may convert a harmless substance into a more toxic substance. With such an important role, the liver protects all the organs of the body. When liver is malfunctioning, toxic metabolites injurious to the brain may be produced. As the brain receives a high blood supply, a large amount of metabolites reach this organ. Hence, the metabolic function of the liver keeps a delicate reciprocal relationship between the two organs. In addition, a number of psychiatric medications affect liver functions. Another perplexing clinical problem is the difficulty in treating psychiatric symptoms in patients with liver disease. For example, benzodiazepines which do not affect the liver function in physically healthy psychiatric patients, may induce hepatic coma in patients with liver disease. Benzodiazepine antagonists produce dramatic and temporary improvement in patients with hepatic coma. Clinically, many psychoactive drugs produce hepatic complications. The very same drugs which produce hepatic side effects are required for the treatment of psychiatric symptoms in patients with hepatic disorders. To appropriately handle these situations, a thorough knowledge of the side effects of these drugs is necessary.",1994,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Female LEC rats were injected intraperitoneally with TTM at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight for 8 consecutive days. More than 2/3 of the Cu accumulating in the liver was removed by TTM treatment 24 h after the last injection. Although most Cu was bound to MT in the soluble fraction before TTM treatment, the Cu remaining in the liver was present almost exclusively in the non-soluble fraction together with molybdenum (Mo). Cu,Zn,Cd-MT was separated from the liver of LEC rats that had been injected with cadmium (Cd) and reacted with TTM at mol ratios of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 to Cu bound to MT for 10 min at 37 degrees C. When TTM was added at a mol ratio of less than 1.0, a Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex was detected, while addition of TTM at a mol ratio of greater than 1.0 selectively removed Cu from MT and produced a Cu/TTM complex via liberation of Zn,Cd-MT from the Cu,Zn,Cd-MT/TTM complex. Excessive TTM appeared to facilitate polymerization of the Cu/TTM complex to insoluble polymers.

The rCMRGlc was determined in the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the cerebral cortex, and the cerebellar hemispheres. The severity of neurological signs, defined by semiquantitative motor impairment scores, correlated highly (r = -0.80) with the reduction of striatal rCMRGlc. Clinical scores, striatal rCMRGlc, and the degree of MRI abnormalities showed no correlation with different indices of dopamine D2 receptor binding. Sequential PET measurements in three patients during treatment with chelating agents revealed a moderate increase of striatal rCMRGlc (in two patients) and a moderate to marked increase of striatal D2 receptor binding (in three patients) in association with clinical improvement. Our data suggest that the rCMRGlc represents a sensitive and objective measure for assessing and monitoring striatal and extrastriatal involvement in WD. The lack of correlation between the dopamine D2 receptor binding and striatal rCMRGlc and structural abnormalities may be explained by the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and different responses to treatment in WD patients.",1996,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The function of most resistance systems is based on the energy-dependent efflux of toxic ions. Some of the efflux systems are ATPases and others are chemiosmotic cation/proton antiporters. The Cd(2+)-resistance ATPase of Gram-positive bacteria (CadA) is membrane cation pump homologous with other bacterial, animal and plant P-type ATPases. CadA has been labeled with 32P from [alpha-32P] ATP and drives ATP-dependent Cd2+ (and Zn2+) uptake by inside-out membrane vesicles (equivalent to efflux from whole cells). Recently, isolated genes defective in the human hereditary diseases of copper metabolism, namely Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease, encode P-type ATPases that are more similar to bacterial CadA than to other ATPases from eukaryotes. The arsenic resistance efflux system transports arsenite [As(III)], alternatively using either a double-polypeptide (ArsA and ArsB) ATPase or a single-polypeptide (ArsB) functioning as a chemiosmotic transporter. The third gene in the arsenic resistance system, arsC, encodes an enzyme that converts intracellular arsenate [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)], the substrate of the efflux system. The triple-polypeptide Czc (Cd2+, Zn2+ and Co2+) chemiosmotic efflux pump consists of inner membrane (CzcA), outer membrane (CzcC) and membrane-spanning (CzcB) proteins that together transport cations from the cytoplasm across the periplasmic space to the outside of the cell.",1996,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

A high concentration of metabolites appeared in blood samples of patients and rats in the early stage after administration of trientine. Furthermore, large amount of trientine metabolites were excreted into the urine of patients. These results suggest that trientine is remarkably subjected to a first-pass effect. The drug concentration area under the curve (AUC) of the unchanged form and the metabolites of trientine in patients was not dependent on the administered dosage. It seems that the absorption process is an important factor for the disposition behavior of trientine, we have also investigated the uptake characteristics of trientine by rat intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles. The uptake characteristics of trientine were similar to the physiological polyamines, spermine and spermidine. The uptake rate of trientine was dose-dependently inhibited by spermine and spermidine. Moreover, spermine competitively inhibited the uptake of trientine with a Ki value of 18.6 muM. This value is very close to the Km value for spermine (30.4 muM). These data suggested that the uptake mechanism of trientine in rat small intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles was almost identical to that of spermine and spermidine, and that the physiological polyamines seem to have the ability to inhibit the absorption of trientine from the gastrointestinal tract.",1996,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Mice and rats received trien-2HCl in the drinking water at concentrations of 0, 120, 600, or 3000 ppm for up to 92 days. Twenty mice and 18 rats of each sex were assigned to each dose group fed either a cereal-based (NIH-31) or a purified (AIN-76A) diet, both containing nutritionally adequate levels of copper. An additional control group of rats and mice received a Cu-deficient AIN-76A diet. This low copper diet resulted in Cu-deficiency symptoms, such as anemia, liver periportal cytomegaly, pancreatic atrophy and multifocal necrosis, spleen hematopoietic cell proliferation, and increased heart weight, together with undetectable levels of plasma copper in rats but not in mice. Trien-2HCl lowered plasma copper levels some-what (at 600 and 3000 ppm) in rats fed the AIN-76A diet, but did not induce the usual signs of copper deficiency. Trien-2HCl caused an increased frequency of uterine dilatation at 3000 ppm in rats fed AIN-76A diet that was not noted in females fed the Cu-deficient diet. Trien-2HCl toxicity occurred only in mice in the highest dose group fed an AIN-76A diet. Increased frequencies of inflammation of the lung interstitium and liver periportal fatty infiltration were seen in both sexes, and hematopoietic cell proliferation was seen in the spleen of males. Kidney and body weights were reduced in males as was the incidence of renal cytoplasmic vacuolization. There were no signs of copper deficiency in mice exposed to trien-2HCl.

We examined the effects of trientine on the spontaneous development of hepatitis and hepatic tumors, by its short-term and long-term administration to Long-Evans cinnamon (LEC) rats with an accumulation of copper in the liver, as animal models of Wilson's disease. Male rats were given trientine in their drinking water at 1500 ppm for 18 weeks, from 6 weeks to 24 weeks of age in short-term experiment, and 1500 ppm for 27 weeks then 750 ppm for 52 weeks, from 8 to 87 weeks of age in the long-term experiment. Development of hepatitis was observed in the control LEC rats at 18 weeks of age. They had high levels of plasma transaminases (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [GOT], glutamic pyruvic transaminase [GPT]), and on pathological examination, hepatocyte destruction was observed. Histological findings revealed that short-term administration of trientine inhibited the development of hepatitis remarkably. The plasma GOT and GPT levels of treated animals were only slightly higher than those of normal LEA (Long-Evans with agouti coat color) rats, a sibling line of LEC rats. Copper levels in the liver were decreased by a maximum of 50 percent. In the long-term administration of trientine, the incidence of hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) in the treated rats was 67 percent that of the untreated LEC rats, and the number of HCCs per rat in the treated group was 0.7 +/- 0.5, being significantly lower as compared with 4.7 +/- 3.5 in the untreated rats. Additionally, the development of cholangiofibrosis in LEC rats was completely prevented by long-term administration of the agent. The copper level in the liver of treated rats was reduced by 33 percent at 87 weeks of age. Development of HCC in LEC rats might be partly, but not totally, because of copper accumulation. No effects on the levels of copper, iron, or zinc in the liver of LEA rats was detected, and no adverse effects were detected in either LEC or LEA rats after both short- and long-term administration of trientine in drinking water.",1996,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
8723319,Metal-induced hepatotoxicity.,R S Britton,"Figure 3 summarizes several proposed mechanisms of iron- or copper-induced hepatotoxicity. It has long been suspected that free radicals may play a role in iron- and copper-induced cell toxicity because of the powerful prooxidant action of iron and copper salts in vitro. In the presence of available cellular reductants, iron or copper in low molecular weight forms may play a catalytic role in the initiation of free radical reactions. The resulting oxyradicals have the potential to damage cellular lipids, nucleic acids, proteins, and carbohydrates, resulting in wide-ranging impairment in cellular function and integrity. However, cells are endowed with cytoprotective mechanisms (antioxidants, scavenging enzymes, repair processes) that act to counteract the effects of free radical production. Thus, the net effect of metal-induced free radicals on cellular function will depend on the balance between radical production and the cytoprotective systems As a result, there may be a rate of free radical production that must be exceeded before cellular injury occurs. Evidence has now accumulated that iron or copper overload in experimental animals can result in oxidative damage to lipids in vivo, once the concentration of the metal exceeds a threshold level. In the liver, this lipid peroxidation is associated with impairment of membrane-dependent functions of mitochondria (oxidative metabolism) and lysosomes (membrane integrity, fluidity, pH). Although these findings do not prove causality, it seems likely that lipid peroxidation is involved, since similar functional defects are produced by metal-induced lipid peroxidation in these organelles in vitro. Both iron and copper overload impair hepatic mitochondrial respiration, primarily through a decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity. In iron overload, hepatocellular calcium homeostasis may be impaired through damage to mitochondrial and microsomal calcium sequestration. DNA has also been reported to be a target of metal-induced damage in the liver; this may have consequences as regards malignant transformation. The levels of some antioxidants in the liver are decreased in rats with iron or copper overload, which is also suggestive of ongoing oxidative stress. Reduced cellular ATP levels, lysosomal fragility, impaired cellular calcium homeostasis, and damage to DNA may all contribute to hepatocellular injury in iron and copper overload. There are few data addressing the key issue of whether free radical production is increased in patients with iron or copper overload. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis have elevated plasma levels of TBA-reactants and increased hepatic levels of MDA-protein and HNE-protein adducts, indicative of lipid peroxidation. Mitochondria isolated from the livers of Wilson disease patients have evidence of lipid peroxidation, and some patients with Wilson disease have decreased hepatic and plasma levels of vitamin E. Additional investigation will be required to fully assess oxidant stress and its potential pathophysiologic role in patients with iron or copper overload.",1996,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Inheritance of a pair of alleles of an autosomal recessive gene on chromosome 13 is necessary and sufficient to cause such copper accumulation in WD; reducing the dietary intake of copper cannot prevent the development of WD. In contrast, the lethal accumulations of copper in children with ICT have been attributed primarily to an increased dietary intake of copper. However, 64 124 child-year exposures of children under the age of 6 y to drinking water containing a copper concentration of approximately 125.9 micromol/L (8 mg/L) produced no deaths from any form of liver disease. Moreover, the ICT of seven infants was attributed primarily to drinking water containing < 110.2 micromol Cu/L (7 mg/L) despite evidence of the presence of a genetic defect in three of the patients, one of whom was exclusively breast-fed.

In addition, lactating tx females produce copper-deficient milk. To characterize further the biochemical basis of this defect, Western blots of tissue extracts from normal and tx mice were probed with various heavy-metal radioisotopes (63Ni. 65Zn and 64Cu). A 30 kDa Ni/Zn-binding polypeptide was found to be markedly decreased in the livers of the tx mice. This protein was isolated from normal adult mice using a procedure based on Ni-chelation chromatography. The amino acid sequences of two CNBr peptides were identical with portions of the mouse skeletal muscle carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII) sequence. Two other peptides sequenced had closely related sequences to that of CAIII, but with two differences in 45 amino acids. These two peptides may be derived from a novel CAIII isoform, which we term CAIIIB to distinguish it from the published form, CAIIIA. We isolated a cDNA clone corresponding to CAIIIA and used this to show that CAIIIA mRNA was also decreased in the mutant liver, but not in muscle. Copper loading of normal mice also decreased hepatic CAIIIA mRNA, suggesting that the decrease in CAIII mRNA in the tx mouse liver is a secondary consequence of the high copper levels in the liver.",1997,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The donor-to-recipient body weight ratio was only 0.82. No homologous blood transfusion was required for the donor, and the donor recovered uneventfully except for mild transient hyperbilirubinemia. The graft provided adequate function for the metabolic needs of the recipient despite postoperative septic complications.

The mechanism of renal excretion of trientine has been investigated in-vivo and in-vitro. Trientine clearance in the rat-was significantly faster than creatinine clearance. When trientine and the same number of moles of copper ions were administered simultaneously to the rat, however, trientine clearance decreased to almost the same level as the creatinine clearance. To clarify this active excretion system for trientine, the uptake of trientine and a physiological polyamine compound, spermine, was investigated using rat renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Although, because trientine and spermine are organic cations, the H+/organic cation transporter is expected to recognize these compounds, neither an outwardly directed H+ gradient nor an inward Na+ gradient stimulated trientine uptake. [14C]Spermine uptake was, nevertheless, trans-stimulated by both unlabelled spermine and trientine and the trans-stimulating effect of spermine on trientine uptake was, furthermore, completely abolished by addition of copper ions to the incubation medium. These results suggest that there is a specific transport system for spermine and trientine on the renal brushborder membrane. This transport system contributes to the secretion of trientine in the kidney proximal tubule but does not recognize the trientine-copper complex.",1997,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Changes in molybdenum (Mo) and Cu concentrations and their biological forms in serum of LEC rats determined at different times after a single intraperitoneal injection were compared with those of Wistar (normal) rats. The change in Mo concentration in serum of normal rats was mono-phasic, whereas in LEC rats it was bi-phasic. The phase in normal rats and the first phase in LEC rats appeared to reflect the process of uptake and disappearance of TTM in the livers of Wistar and LEC rats. On the other hand, the second phase in LEC rats paralleled the changes of Cu and appeared to reflect the complex formation (Cu/thiomolybdate complex) between Mo and Cu accumulated in the liver. The complex was specifically bound to albumin as determined by high performance liquid chromatography with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ICP-MS).

The corresponding gene locus has been localized on the long arm of chromosome 13. Three different clinical variants of the disease can be distinguished: hepato-cerebral, abdominal/hepatic, and central nervous type. The heterogeneity of symptoms can cause problems in differential diagnosis, especially when another concordant disorder can also explain the pathogenesis of symptoms. The case report of a young man who suffered from brainstem contusion demonstrates the possibilities of misinterpretation because presenting symptoms could be attributed either to traumatic brain injury followed by adjustment disorder or Wilson's disease.

Ionic Cu (cuprous and cupric ions) were incorporated more efficiently than the metal bound to metallothionein. Cu binds not only to the Cu-binding site but also to the Zn-binding site. Although Zn in the reaction medium and the metal bound to the Zn-binding site of SOD affected little the reactivity in binding of ionic Cu, they disturbed the reactivity of Cu bound to metallothionein to the Cu-binding site. Both ionic and metallothionein-bound Zn were transferred at a comparable efficiency to the Zn-binding site but not to the Cu-binding site. Co-existing ionic Cu but not metallothionein-bound Cu in the medium inhibited the binding of Zn to SOD.

Cu concentration in the liver of female rats was approximately 220 micrograms/g liver at 2 weeks of age, decreased to 100 micrograms/g liver at 4-6 weeks, and then started to increase with age linearly to the highest concentration of 250 micrograms/g liver at 16 weeks. Although the Cu level expressed by concentration (microgram/g liver) decreased during weaning, it increased linearly with age when it was expressed by content (mg/liver), indicating a constant and preferential accumulation of Cu in the liver. Cu concentration stopped increasing at 16 weeks in the liver, followed by a sudden decrease to 1/2 the highest level. Biological markers (serum lactate dehydrogenase and glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase activities) for liver damage started to increase, together with the appearance of signs of jaundice, when Cu attained the highest concentration. Distributions of Cu and zinc (Zn) in the supernatant fraction of the liver indicated that both metals were mostly distributed to metallothionein (MT) and, to a small extent, to superoxide dismutase on a gel filtration column throughout the course of the experiments. Serum Cu concentration started to increase in a form of ceruloplasmin, together with serum marker enzyme activities for liver damage. Cu concentration in the kidneys also started to increase after the increase of serum Cu. The results indicate that Cu accumulates in the form of MT in the liver of LEC rats to a maximum level of approximately 250 micrograms/g liver, and then decreases suddenly with the onset of acute hepatitis. The maximum level seems to be related to the capacity of MT synthesis, and acute hepatitis is assumed to occur when Cu accumulates beyond the capacity. Serum Cu started to increase, from the abnormally low level, when the metal accumulated beyond the capacity of MT synthesis in the liver, and it was partly reabsorbed by the kidneys and the rest was excreted into urine. Changes in iron and zinc levels were determined and discussed in relation to those of Cu.",1995,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Based on the triennial Pewterers Lecture delivered at the National Hospital for Neurology, London, on 23 March 1995.",J M Walshe,"Copper is an essential trace element with a well established mechanism for maintaining balance of the metal in the body, which is controlled by at least two genes. Disruption of one gene on the X chromosome determines a defect in the process of copper absorption, with consequent deficiency of available copper at the cellular level. This results in abnormalities of collagen formation and brain maturation, leading to early death. As yet there is no effective treatment. Disruption of the other copper controlling gene, located on chromosome 13, is associated with accumulation of excess copper in the body, first in the liver leading to cirrhosis, and then in the brain giving rise to destruction of the centre of motor control and, frequently, changes in personality. Copper excess can also cause renal damage, osteoarticular changes and joint pains. If the renal lesion leads to calcium loss in the urine and other tubular defects, there may be osteoporosis or, occasionally, osteomalacia with pathological fractures. In this disease, the abnormal stores of copper can be mobilised with chelating agents or depleted by the administration of zinc salts or thiomolybdate. This usually, but not invariably, leads to improvement or even complete reversal of symptoms. Brain lesions, as demonstrated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may also resolve. The mechanism of this phenomenon is obscure but suggests that the long held doctrine that there is no recovery in the central nervous system may have to be reviewed.",1995,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In patients of this group histopathology revealed liver cirrhosis (n = 7) and fibrosis (n = 2). Common feature of this patient group was marked inflammatory cell infiltration into fibrous septa, increase of copper concentration in liver parenchyma and distinct pathological changes of laboratory data. In the remaining 6 patients no pathological change of liver morphology was demonstrated by MRI corresponding to slight histopathological changes of parenchyma and normal laboratory data. As low-intensity nodules surrounded by high intensity septa can be demonstrated in patients with marked inflammatory infiltration of liver parenchyma MRI may help to define Wilson patients with poorer prognosis.

The hepatic Cu (100 micrograms/g) and metallothionein (MT) bound Cu (from 2,600 to 540 micrograms/g protein) concentrations were decreased greatly by the injection. On the other hand, the renal Cu concentration increased significantly, but the brain Cu concentration only very slightly. The reduction of the hepatic Cu concentration was accompanied by reductions of Zn and Fe concentrations in the liver, kidney and brain. The TTM compound slightly stimulated excretion (about 3-fold) of Cu into the bile, but greatly (about 40-fold) into the blood. In rats not treated with TTM, most biliary (100%) and serum (78%) Cu was recovered in the trichloroacetic acid (TCA) soluble fraction. On the other hand, in rats treated with TTM, bile and serum Cu were recovered overwhelmingly in the TCA insoluble fraction, probably in the form of a Cu-TTM-albumin complex.

The author's formulation of efficacy and toxicity suggests that certain medications commonly used in movement disorders should be discontinued before pregnancy, if possible. These medications include neuroleptics, amantadine, diazepam, primidone, selegiline, and reserpine. Pregnancy may unmask a pre-existing potential for chorea (i.e., chorea gravidarum) and frequently has a mild exacerbating effect on symptoms of PD; however, it has little effect on other movement disorders.

No consistent significant correlations between copper metabolism and pyramidal tract function tested by magnetic brain stimulation were found. An improvement of CCTs and response amplitudes with copper elimination therapy was observed only at early phases of therapy. There was no correlation with duration of therapy or neurological symptoms.

Although the concentration of Mo taken up by the kidney decreased over time after an initial increase in both rats, Cu concentration increased over time. Cu was not redistributed to the brain. Excretion of Mo through urine was decreased and that into feces was increased in LEC rats compared with those in Wistar rats.

In 1952, Scheinberg demonstrated a deficiency of serum ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease, and it became possible to diagnose the illness while the patient was still asymptomatic. In 1956, Walshe introduced penicillamine as the most excellent drug for treatment of the disease. These epoch-making discoveries encouraged Japanese physicians to make early diagnosis and to try prevention of the disease. This lecture was to review the changing panorama in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of the disease in the period of forty years focusing on the experiences in Japan. Early detection of the patients based on hypoceruloplasminemia made it possible to investigate the onset ages of an elevation of serum GOT or GPT and the appearance of Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings. So far, the youngest patients who exhibited high GPT level and KF rings were three years and five years old, respectively. It became popular that an unexpected elevation of serum transaminase in apparently healthy children of three years or more prompted to examine the possibility of Wilson's disease, and an increasing number of non-familial patients in late infancy have been detected. Now, the mass-screening for Wilson's disease is in progress. Follow-up studies on the prophylaxis for more than thirty years definitely proved that the appearance of clinical symptoms was prevented with the continued penicillamine therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1995,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Features and appropriate management.,"M A Aldersley, J G O'Grady","The spectrum of liver disease is extremely wide, with many of the underlying disorders having acute and chronic presentations. Most of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are accounted for by autoimmune disease, viral infection and toxic insult. The management strategy of any liver disease is a combination of treating the symptoms and complications that arise, as well as drug therapies relevant to the specific underlying diagnosis. Encephalopathy, ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, variceal bleeding and pruritus are the main complications at which drug therapy is directed, although in some cases it represents only 1 aspect of the overall management. Drug therapy per se is largely ineffective in acute liver failure with the possible exception of acetylcysteine, but many drugs are used in the management of the constituent components of this complex medical emergency. Treatments for specific liver conditions are expanding, especially in the areas of autoimmune and viral disease. The increasing availability and success of liver transplantation has tended to change the emphasis of management, and it is often not appropriate to exhaust the treatment options before referring the patient for transplantation.

Massive Cu is liberated from MT when Cu accumulates beyond the capacity of MT synthesis. Cu bound to MT is not supplied to ceruloplasmin (Cp) during its maturation process, while the metal is transferred to Cu,zinc (Zn)-superoxide dismutase (SOD) directly from MT. Cu ions not bound to MT are transferred to Cp and the holo-Cp is excreted into the bloodstream near and at the onset of jaundice. Cu accumulated in the liver in a form bound to MT is removed selectively by tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), and the animal at the beginning of the onset of jaundice recovers by the chelation therapy. Mechanisms of the removal reaction were proposed to involve formation of MT/TTM, Cu/TTM, and/or polymeric Cu/TTM complexes according to the stoichiometry of TTM to Cu. The Cu/TTM complex was assumed to be effluxed into the bloodstream and to bind specifically to albumin. TTM is taken up by the liver in accordance with the Cu content. The toxicity of Cu was explained by the active oxygen species produced in Cu-mediated reactions, and the participation of MT.",1995,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The data show a progressive decrease in both serum copper and zinc concentrations in all. Urinary copper excretion gradually levelled off to approximately 50% of initial values, but zinc excretion increased. Urinary zinc:copper ratios therefore increased with the duration of treatment. Copper elimination was considered adequate as soon as challenge with a test dose of D-penicillamine did not result in an increase in copper excretion. Urinary zinc excretion was increased further by the test dose. Zinc depletion was suspected clinically in one patient on D-penicillamine maintenance treatment. Lowering the dose alleviated the symptoms, urinary zinc loss decreased from 64 to 34 mumol/24 hours, and copper excretion remained largely unchanged. Data obtained indicate that D-penicillamine alters the metabolism of both copper and zinc. The extent of this is not only dose dependent but is also related to the efficacy of copper elimination.

The course, judged by clinical, biochemical, and histological parameters was satisfactory in both. The urinary copper concentration reverted to less than 1.26 mumol/24 hours; and the serum copper concentration decreased further during zinc sulphate treatment. In one child the rise in 24 hour urinary copper excretion observed after a challenge dose of D-penicillamine (+/- 20 mg/kg) remained constant throughout the period of observation while the liver copper content fell from 1460 micrograms/g dry weight to 890 micrograms/g dry weight. In the other patient, however, the liver copper content as well as the 24 hour urinary copper excretion increased after D-penicillamine challenge during the third year of treatment.

3886759,Interactions of trace elements: clinical significance.,"G J Brewer, G M Hill, R D Dick, A S Prasad, Z T Cossack","We examined interaction of the trace element zinc with copper and lead. In sickle cell anemia, the usual situation is one of mild to moderate zinc deficiency owing to renal loss of zinc. Zinc deficiency seems to produce a mild overburden of copper and an increased ceruloplasmin level, probably by enhancing copper absorption. With zinc therapy, this process is reversed. Pharmacological doses of zinc, when administered in a way to ensure effectiveness (without food) will usually lead to copper deficiency. We have taken advantage of the copper-depleting effect of zinc to design a new therapy for Wilson's disease. Zinc, by inducing intestinal metallothionein, inhibits absorption of copper from food, and inhibits reabsorption of endogenously secreted copper, thereby producing a negative copper balance in Wilson's disease. Once we are certain that zinc blocks accumulation of copper in the liver of Wilson's disease patients, zinc therapy will be available as one approach for treating this fatal disease. The animal literature indicates that zinc protects against lead toxicity when both elements are given orally, no doubt through the intestinal metallothionein mechanism. In preliminary experiments in rats, we have not been able to show that toxicity from lead that arrives into the body through a nonoral route is affected by oral zinc supplements.",1985,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Twenty seven patients were managed with zinc sulphate for a total period of 142 patients-years. The drug was administered in doses varying from 300 to 1200 mg/day. Of the 9 patients who were treated with zinc from the start, 8 improved and one died from severe cirrhosis. All 8 patients who were placed on zinc after intolerance to penicillamine did well on zinc therapy. Ten patients were changed to zinc after they had first been treated with penicillamine without developing signs of intolerance. Of this group 8 patients were kept on long-term zinc therapy, 2 were changed back to penicillamine because of personal preference. Signs of intolerance to zinc were not observed. All patients kept a diet containing about 1.2 mg of copper a day.

Lethargy and anorexia (70%) jaundice (56%) and abdominal pain (48%) were the commonest symptoms and less common were intellectual deterioration (22%) and recurrent epistaxes (22%). The duration of symptoms before diagnosis ranged from five days to three years (mean 10.5 months) and in only five of the patients was the diagnosis established before referral. Analysis of the physical signs at presentation showed hepatomegaly (81%) and splenomegaly (70%) to be common and the only signs which were significantly more common in the 13 fatal cases were jaundice and ascites. In three of these and in one other patient who survived the clinical course was exceptionally severe and was indistinguishable from fulminant hepatic failure. Based on the severity of abnormality of serum aspartate aminotransferase, bilirubin, and prothrombin time on admission a prognostic index was derived which enabled complete separation of fatal and nonfatal cases and when subsequently used in a further nine index cases correctly predicted the outcome. Two further cases found to have indices in the fatal category did well after liver transplantation, which needs to be considered as soon as the diagnosis is established in cases with such severe liver damage.",1986,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Treatment of ""cold"" rat liver cytosol ""spiked"" with purified [35S] metallothionein with Penicillamine and Trientine showed that even at relatively high concentrations (up to 50 mg/g liver, wet weight), these compounds had no effect on the copper peak or the position of the [35S] label in the cytosol eluate after Sephadex G-75 gel filtration. By contrast, incubation of the ""spiked"" liver cytosol with Trithiomolybdate, even at relatively low concentrations (0.5 mg/g liver, wet weight), resulted in a transfer of metallothionein copper to high molecular weight protein fractions; the position of the [35S] apoprotein was unaffected. This copper ""stripping"" effect on metallothionein supports clinical and other evidence that thiomolybdates have a genuine decoppering effect in vivo whereas Penicillamine and Trientine have another mode of action and indicates that thiomolybdates might provide a more rational alternate therapy for Wilson's disease patients.",1991,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The initial myasthenia symptoms in all patients consisted of variable diplopia and/or ptosis with progression to a more generalized involvement in 7 of them. No clinical, humoral, or genetic factor was determined which would allow identification of individuals developing generalized as opposed to ocular myasthenia. Withdrawal of penicillamine was associated over 4-60 weeks with a slow resolution of symptoms, facilitated in 12 patients by the use of anticholinesterase agents. In 2 patients a persistent partial unilateral ptosis remains after 15 and 25 months, while in a further patient diplopia is present 42 months after resolution of the other myasthenic symptoms. The patients with PIM when compared with a healthy 'control' population had a significant increase in HLA Dr1 (p corr less than 0.005) and an absence of HLA Dr 3.

The hyperphosphaturia and hypercalciuria were attributed to the Fanconi syndrome, a known component of Wilson's disease. Circulating immunoreactive parathyroid hormone was usually undetectable or, occasionally, detectable at minimal levels in the presence of depressed blood levels of ionized calcium. Normal levels of ionized calcium were not maintained throughout a 24-hour monitoring period. The patient had tetany during a period of rapid reduction in ionized calcium levels, and an appropriate rise in circulating immunoreactive parathyroid levels was never demonstrated. Induced hypocalcemia during citrate infusion did not stimulate parathyroid secretion, nor did infusion of magnesium.

The characteristics of the direct pattern are predominantly mitochondrial damage, central (zone 3) necrosis, and, usually, fatty change. It can be subdivided into the alcohol type (also seen with obesity, in diabetes, as a reaction to perhexiline, in Wilson's disease, and in Indian childhood cirrhosis) and the Reye's syndrome type (also seen with tetracycline toxicity, fatty liver of pregnancy, and cytotoxic drugs). Reactive drug metabolites, metal poisoning, and anoxia are also associated with the direct pattern of hepatocyte injury. The immunological pattern is characterised by damage to cell membranes with piecemeal necrosis of periportal (zone 1) hepatocytes and mononuclear-cell infiltration. Examples include chronic active hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and drug reactions such as those to halothane. In the cholestatic pattern there is disturbance of the bile-secretory mechanism with retention of bile within the hepatocytes. Cholestatic liver injury may be intrahepatic, as in sex-hormone cholestasis, or extrahepatic, as in choledocholithiasis or carcinoma of the bile ducts.

Serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase increased equally in both groups. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were lower in the D-penicillamine group, but serum albumin was also lower in this group. Liver histology worsened equally in both groups. Major side effects, some appearing more than 24 months after the start of treatment, occurred in 31 per cent of the patients receiving D-penicillamine.

Pronounced changes characterized primarily by a considerable diminution of dopamine and noradrenaline excretion and an increase of the excretion of their immediate precursor, i.e. DOPA, were noted. On the basis of the data obtained it was assumed that the synthesis of these neurotransmitting catecholamines was depressed. In the course of treatment with d-penicillamine which is capable of mobilizing copper and stimulating its excretion from the body a statistically significant increase of the dopamine excretion (as compared with its initial level) was noted, and in patients with the graver rigid-arrhythmohyperkinetic form of the disease the excretion of not only dopamine, but also noradrenaline, was increased. It is supposed that the disturbances of catecholamine metabolism in hepatocerebral dystrophy have a complicated mechanism, and are associated with both the grave hepatic pathology and disturbances of copper metabolism. In this connection additional methods of treating that disease are offered. These methods influence catecholamine metabolism, and act primarily on extrapyramid motor, and also psychic disorders.

6413769,Metallothionein--aspects related to copper and zinc metabolism.,R J Cousins,"Metallothionein is a cysteine-rich, low molecular weight protein that binds zinc, copper and cadmium. It is inducible in liver, kidney and intestine by glucocorticoids, changes in the dietary zinc supply, acute administration of various metals, food restriction, infection, stress and endotoxin treatment. Regulation of synthesis involves altered gene expression. The protein is fairly rapidly degraded when zinc is the primary metal species bound, but the degradation rate is diminished when cadmium or copper are bound as well. The net result of metallothionein production seems to be accumulation of bound metal and/or intracellular metal redistribution. The accumulation of copper in various tissues of individuals with Menkes' and Wilson's diseases may be related to altered metallothionein turnover. The physiological function is not clear, but the response of metallothionein to hormonal stimuli is suggestive of an important role in cellular metabolism.",1983,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

A series of experiments were conducted to substantiate the effects of high dosages of Zn on Cu absorption using the experimental animal model. In the first experiment, five groups of mice were fed five different levels of Zn: 6 ppm (basal diet), 30 ppm (control), 750 ppm, 1,000 ppm, and 2,400 ppm, for a period of 35 days. 64Cu-loading test was conducted to measure whole body retention (WBR) of 64Cu at the 10th, 14th, 21st, and 35th day. Results showed that the inhibition of 64Cu absorption by Zn is dose- and time-dependent. However, maximum inhibition occurred in mice fed 1,000 ppm of Zn, and no additional effect was observed in mice fed 2,400 ppm of Zn. In the second experiment, the distribution between the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and gut-free carcass, of the retained dose of 64Cu, was measured in controls and in the group fed 750 ppm of Zn. While WBR of 64Cu was significantly lower (p less than 0.01) in mice fed 750 ppm of Zn, the distribution of the retained dose was not affected. In the third experiment, a group of mice was fed 30 ppm of Zn for a period of 70 days (control), and a second group was fed 1,000 ppm of Zn for the first 35 days (repletion), after which they were switched to the basal diet (6 ppm) for the following 35 days (depletion).

These effects were compared with those of penicillamine, a chelating agent utilized in the therapy of the genetic abnormality of copper metabolism in humans, Wilson's disease. Cobalt elicited an increased (approximately 4-fold) urinary excretion of copper lasting through 72 h following a single cobalt dose. In contrast to the marked increase in urinary zinc excretion produced by penicillamine, cobalt greatly reduced (approximately 75%) zinc output in urine. Tissue copper and zinc concentrations were measured after treatment with cobalt at doses ranging from 12 to 60 mg/kg body weight. Substantially reduced (approximately 25%) renal copper concentration was observed at 1 and 3 d after cobalt administration. In addition, cobalt produced a concurrent dose-dependent elevation (up to 1.6-fold) in hepatic zinc concentration. Cytosolic zinc was eluted from a Sephadex G-75 column in the molecular weight region associated with metallothionein. Time-dependent induction of metallothionein concentration (10-fold) in liver by cobalt was confirmed by the cadmium/hemoglobin affinity assay.

Protection of the liver from copper toxicity by zinc-induced metallothionein in a rat model.,"D Y Lee, G J Brewer, Y X Wang","Patients with Wilson's disease often have a further increase in hepatic copper when given zinc as an initial treatment, although there is no associated clinical deterioration. To better understand this situation an animal model was developed in which copper-loaded rats are treated with zinc administered subcutaneously. In the presence of equal amounts of copper loading in liver, control rats show hepatic damage but zinc-treated rats do not. Zinc-treated rats have much higher levels of hepatic metallothionein. Gel filtration studies reveal that much of the hepatic copper in zinc-treated rats is in this metallothionein fraction, whereas the copper in control animals is primarily associated with fractions of high or low molecular weight. Subcutaneous zinc therapy also induces intestinal, but not brain, metallothionein. We interpret these findings to indicate that zinc therapy protects against copper toxicity in liver by induction of hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters copper in a nontoxic form.",1989,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

It is generally thought that the chelators act by mobilizing copper from the liver, hence allowing excretion in the urine. This paper has examined the effect of chelators on copper uptake and storage in mouse hepatocytes. Penicillamine, a clinically important chelator, does not block the uptake of copper or remove copper from hepatocytes. Two other copper chelators, sar and diamsar, which form very stable and kinetically inert Cu2+ complexes by encapsulating the metal ion in an organic cage, were shown to block copper accumulation by the cells and to remove up to 80% of cell-associated copper. They also removed most (approximately 80%) of the 64Cu accumulated by the cells in 30 min, but released only a small percentage (less than 20%) of that accumulated over 18 h. The results show that copper in the hepatocyte can be divided into at least two pools, an easily accessible one, and another, not removable even after long-term incubation with any of the chelators. Most of the copper normally found in the cell appeared to be associated with the former pool.",1989,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

However, penicillamine binds to precursors of intermolecular crosslinks both in collagen and elastin, and could lead to alterations of these two fibrous proteins. In the present report skin biopsies from patients with Wilson's disease, treated with 900 mg/day of D-penicillamine, for 5, 9, 58 and 60 months, were studied by electron microscopy and compared with findings obtained from skin biopsies of age-matched normal subjects. Clinically, the elasticity and consistency of the skin of Wilson's patients was not modified by D-penicillamine treatment. The ultrastructural organization of collagen fibrils appeared normal in the adults treated with D-penicillamine for 5-9 months. In a 15-year-old girl, treated for 48 months, a high number of collagen fibrils were swollen and unreeved. Elastin fibers were altered in all patients. The alterations were mostly pronounced in the reticular dermis, were proportional to the time of treatment, and consisted of polymorphous aggregates of elastin connected to apparently normal elastin fibers. A stereological analysis, on EM pictures from the patient treated for 60 months, and from an age-matched control, showed a significant decrease in the percentage of collagen and of the mean area occupied by each collagen bundle in the reticular dermis of the patient compared to control; on the contrary, the number of elastin fibers per unit area increased significantly, and the mean area of each elastin fiber decreased. The volume density of elastin was similar to control.

There has been no reports regarding the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the body. In the current study, the absorption and excretion of TE in rats were examined. The observed mean percentage amount of TE absorbed at the jejunum and ileum with the loop method for 1 h was 42.0% and 22.5%, respectively. Tight junction blocking agent inhibited the absorption of TE from the jejunum loop with 27%, but the absorption of TE from the ileum loop was not affected by this blocking agent. Therefore, the main absorption route for TE might be permeation across the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. TE and amikacin, a polycationic compound like TE, bound to the brush border membrane (BBM) of rat small intestine in the absence of inorganic ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cu2+. But the binding of TE to BBM was inhibited markedly under the physiological concentration of these ions. The bioavailability of TE was below 10% and the plasma levels of TE in non-fasted rats were significantly lower than that observed in fasted rats. The urinary excretion of unchanged TE during 24 h was only 3.5% of the orally administered dose. However, the urinary excretion of total TE including metabolites, though they have not been identified, was 35.7%. These results suggest that low bioavailability of TE might be due to the rapid metabolism in the body after absorption from the gastrointestinal tract.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The data indicates that penicillamine removes copper from some intermediary ligand, thereby making it available to induce metallothionein. It is possible that this is part of the therapeutic action of the chelator in the treatment of Wilson's disease.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Gastroduodenal intubation was performed in six healthy subjects and five patients with Wilson's disease. After intravenous infusion of octapeptide of cholecystokinin (40 ng/kg/hr) the pancreaticobiliary secretion of zinc increased from a basal rate of 283.1 +/- 75.8 nmol/L/min to a peak of 716.6 +/- 175.3 nmol/L/min in normal subjects. Normal subjects with a zinc-deficient diet had both lower basal (66.8 +/- 15.8 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (559.5 +/- 31 nmol/L/min) pancreaticobiliary secretion of zinc than with a zinc-sufficient diet. In contrast to the markedly reduced pancreaticobiliary secretion of copper, patients with Wilson's disease not treated with zinc had normal basal (226.6 +/- 126 nmol/L/min) and stimulated (728.7 +/- 195.5 nmol/L/min) zinc secretion. These studies indicate that a considerable amount of zinc is being secreted in pancreaticobiliary fluid in healthy subjects and there was no impairment of zinc secretion in patients with Wilson's disease. Our data also indicate that pancreaticobiliary secretion of zinc is dependent on the zinc status of the subjects, suggesting that endogenous secretion of zinc may play a significant role in the homeostasis of zinc.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
2267049,[Hepatolenticular degeneration].,"D Zudenigo, M Relja","Hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson's disease) is a hereditary disease in which metabolic disorder of copper leads to its accumulation in the liver, brain, cornea and kidneys with consequent pathologic changes in those organs. Hereditary mechanism of the disease is autosomal recessive with prevalence of 30-100 per 1,000,000 inhabitants. Etiology of this disease is not yet explained. There are two hypotheses. The first one is that it is the disorder of ceruloplasmine metabolism caused by insufficient synthesis of normal ceruloplasmine, or synthesis of functionally abnormal ceruloplasmine. The second one is: the block of copper biliar excretion which is the consequence of the liver lysosomes functional defect. Pathogenetic mechanism of disease is firstly long-term accumulation of copper in the liver, and later, when the liver depo is full, its releasing in circulation and accumulation in the brain, cornea, kidneys and bones, which causes adequate pathologic changes. Toxic activity of copper is the consequence of its activity on enzymes, particularly on those with -SH group. There are two basic clinical forms of the disease: liver disease or neurologic disease. Before puberty the liver damage is more frequent, while in adolescents and young adults neurologic form of the disease is usual. The liver disease is nonspecific and characterized by symptoms of cirrhosis and chronic aggressive hepatitis. The only specificity is hemolytic anemia which, in combination with previous symptoms, is important for diagnosis of the disease. Neurologic symptoms are the most frequent consequence of pathologic changes in the basal ganglia. In our patients the most frequent symptoms were tremor (63%); dysarthria, choreoathetosis and rigor (38%); ataxia and mental disorders (31%); dysphagia and dystonia (12%), diplopia, hypersalivation, nystagmus and Babinski's sign (6%). Among pathologic changes in other tissues and organs the most important is the finding of Kayser-Fleischer ring in the cornea as a result of copper accumulation. Its importance for precise diagnosis is great. The diagnosis of the disease is based on anamnesis, clinical examination, specific and nonspecific laboratory tests. The therapy of choice is penicillamine. If we use it early, the result will be good remission in the majority of patients. Late diagnosis or delay in treatment cause death which is the result of bleeding from esophageal varices or basal ganglia disease. Immunologic damages caused by penicillamine demand interruption of therapy and substitution by three-ethyl-tetra-amine (TETA). We also use zinc salts and tetratiomolibdate in therapy of this disease. Pathogenesis, clinical picture and therapy of the disease are based on our own results.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In the first patient the diagnosis was histologically confirmed only after three weeks, and onset of treatment with penicillamine was therefore delayed. With this medication the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, cholinesterase and total bilirubin returned to normal, but again became abnormal after about seven weeks. Despite substitution of clotting factors thromboplastin time remained reduced. She died 82 days after the onset of symptoms. In the second patient, treatment with penicillamine was started at once, without waiting for histological confirmation. All laboratory values became normal and remained so. It is concluded from these observations that liver transplantation is indicated if the abnormal values for cholinesterase, thromboplastin time and bilirubin do not remain normal after six weeks and if the initial suppression of alkaline phosphatase continues or occurs again.",1989,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The zink concentration in the patients' blood serum prior to treatment tended to decline. Such a decrease was also noted in cirrhosis of other etiologies. Thiol therapy resulted in a gradual increase in the urine zink elimination which followed a pattern of the drug dose increment and could be two to three times higher than normal in cases of prolonged treatment. Nevertheless, these patients exhibited no symptoms of zink insufficiency and the zink concentration in the blood serum had been normal for a number of years, which may be explained by an enhanced absorption of zink from the intestines and by its mobilization from the tissue depots.

In excess, these ions are associated with neurological disorders such as Wilson's disease, Pick's disease and epileptic seizures. We suggest that zinc ions, which are contained in nerve terminals, are extruded into the extracellular space during neuronal activity. Excessive levels of zinc may be released during intense neuronal activation, and contribute to the paroxysm and toxic damage observed. Zinc ions are contained in high concentrations in mossy fibres of the hippocampal formation, and it is the postsynaptic neurones of these fibres which are most susceptible to the toxic effects of kainic acid, a potent convulsant, or to chronic exposure to organometallic compounds.

First, three kinds of preparations (osmium-Epon sections, glutaraldehyde-frozen sections, and unfixed-frozen sections) were compared for element detectability at a subcellular level. The glutaraldehyde-frozen sections were satisfactory as far as copper, sulfur, and phosphorus were concerned. Five patients (one patient with Wilson's disease, one chronic cholestasis, one chronic hepatitis, and two asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis) yielded x-ray images of copper and sulfur consistent with hepatocellular lysosomes. Second, the glutaraldehyde-frozen sections were utilized for a study of copper deposits in the patients' livers. There was a significant correlation between copper and sulfur contents in the lysosomes of all patients studied but no correlation in the remainder of the cytoplasm. Zinc was not detected in the lysosomes. Whatever the content of copper in the lysosomes, the ratio of delta copper to phosphorus (weight/weight) to delta sulfur to phosphorus was 0.60.

The symptoms of Wilsons disease include hepatic or neurological conditions. The hepatic condition is manifested as steatosis, acute or chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. The neurological conditions are most often manifested after the age of 20 as motor disorders (tremor, speech and writing disorders), which may result in severe extrapyramidal syndrome with rigidity, dysarthria and muscle contractions. The dia-gnosis is based on clinical and laboratory assessments (neurological signs, liver lesions, low ceruloplasmin, increased free serum copper, high Cu volumes in urine, KayserFleischer ring). The dia-gnosis is confirmed by a high Cu level in liver tissue or genetic proof. Untreated Wilsons disease causes death of the patient. If treated properly the survival rate approximates to the survival rate of the common population. The treatment concerns either removal of copper from the body using chelating agents excreted into the urine (Penicillamine, Trientine) or limitation of copper absorption from the intestine and reducing the toxicity of copper (zinc, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate). In the Czech Republic, Penicillamine or zinc is used. A liver transplant is indicated in patients with fulminant hepatic failure or decompensated liver cirrhosis.

ACC is found in 40% of the cases of Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a polytopic embryonic defect including a distinctive facial gestalt, severe mental retardation, epilepsy and postnatal microcephaly as constant features. Other manifestations involve Hirschsprung disease, cardiac defects, renal abnormalities and hypospadias. Among this broad spectrum of malformations recently associated with haploinsufficiency of the zinc finger homeobox 1B gene (ZFHX1B), ACC can therefore be the only feature to be detected prenatally.

15054912,"Zinc for prostate disease and other conditions: a little evidence, a lot of hype, and a significant potential problem.",Mark A Moyad,"Dietary and supplemental zinc, especially in excess, has received much attention in numerous alternative medicine resources. There is a small amount of medical evidence that zinc may alleviate some mostly rare medical conditions (such as Wilson's disease). However, in prostate conditions, such as BPH, large concentrations of zinc are found in the prostate gland. Excess intake of zinc, especially with individual supplements, has the potential to encourage the growth of prostate conditions from BPH to cancer. In fact, one large study found a significantly higher risk of advanced prostate cancer in men consuming large intakes of these supplements. Large doses of zinc can inhibit the benefits of bisphosphonate drugs, increase testosterone level, increase cholesterol, reduce levels of ""good cholesterol"" or HDL, and can promote immune dysfunction. More research is needed in this area, but in the meantime, the time seems more than ripe to discourage or immediately discontinue the intake of larger concentrations of zinc for most individuals until adequate research resolves this controversial issue.",2004,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

A hepatic presentation is more common in young children. Neurologic Wilson's disease often manifests as a movement disorder with dystonia, tremor, and dysarthria. Psychiatric or behavioral symptoms can also be a presenting feature of Wilson's disease. We describe an atypical neurologic presentation in a prepubertal child with minimal hepatic involvement; in which transient hemiparesis and encephalopathy dominated her initial neurologic presentation. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive cortical and subcortical signal change, in addition to the classical basal ganglia signal abnormality observed in Wilson's disease. She was treated with oral tetrathiomolybdate anticopper therapy, followed by zinc maintenance. Her clinical status and brain imaging improved considerably at 1 year after treatment initiation. Neurologic Wilson's disease may have diverse presentations, and should be considered in children who present with cortical features and signal change on magnetic resonance imaging.",2004,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
14723607,Review article: diagnosis and current therapy of Wilson's disease.,P Ferenci,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism resulting in liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric disease. The diagnosis of neurological disease is straightforward if the following symptoms are present: Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurological symptoms and low serum ceruloplasmin levels. The diagnosis is more complex in patients presenting with liver diseases. None of the commonly used parameters alone allows a diagnosis with certainty. A combination of various laboratory parameters is necessary to firmly establish the diagnosis. In the future, limited mutation analysis may play an important diagnostic role. Recently, a group of international experts has proposed a score based on a variety of tests and clinical symptoms. The validity of this score needs to be assessed prospectively. Treatment requires life-long administration of copper chelators (d-penicillamine, trientine). A frequently used alternative is zinc. None of these treatments has been tested by prospective randomized controlled studies.

14510639,The nucleotide-binding domain of the Zn2+-transporting P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli carries a glycine motif that may be involved in binding of ATP.,"Juha Okkeri, Liisa Laakkonen, Tuomas Haltia","In P-type ATPases, the nucleotide-binding (N) domain is located in the middle of the sequence which folds into the phosphorylation (P) domain. The N domain of ZntA, a Zn2+-translocating P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli, is approx. 13% identical with the N domain of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. None of the Ca2+-ATPase residues involved in binding of ATP are found in ZntA. However, the sequence G503SGIEAQV in the N domain of ZntA resembles the motif GxGxxG, which forms part of the ATP-binding site in protein kinases. This motif is also found in Wilson disease protein where several disease mutations cluster in it. In the present work, we have made a set of disease mutation analogues, including the mutants G503S (Gly503-->Ser), G505R and A508F of ZntA. At low [ATP], these mutant ATPases are poorly phosphorylated. The phosphorylation defect of the mutants G503S and G505R can, however, be partially (G503S) or fully (G505R) compensated for by using a higher [ATP], suggesting that these mutations lower the affinity for ATP. In all three mutant ATPases, phosphorylation by P(i) has become less sensitive to the presence of ATP, also consistent with the proposal that the Gly503 motif plays a role in ATP binding. In order to test this hypothesis, we have modelled the N domain of ZntA using the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase structure as a template. In the model, the Gly503 motif, as well as the residues Glu470 and His475, are located in the proximity of the ATP-binding site. In conclusion, the mutagenesis data and the molecular model are consistent with the idea that the two loops carrying the residues Glu470, His475, Gly503 and Gly505 play a role in ATP binding and activation.",2004,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Causative treatment has been impossible so far, although gene therapy could be real in the future. Nowadays the principle of treatment is the elimination of the excess of easily mobilized copper by chelating agents or blocking the intestinal absorption of copper. Chelation therapy, aimed at mobilizing copper from the affected organs and promoting its excretion in the urine or stool is the most important. The major chelating agent is d-penicillamine, which is quite effective but not without some side effects. Alternative chelating agents such as trientine and tetrathiomolybdate have also been successfully employed. Zinc salts are also of therapeutic value. They promote copper excretion by inducing the synthesis of metallothionein in the intestine, thereby blocking copper absorption from the gut. Zinc salts have almost no side effects. They cannot be used as an initial treatment, but are very effective for maintenance therapy. The chelation therapy is ineffective in patients with acute liver failure with encephalopathy and hemolysis. In these cases, liver transplantation is the only hope for survival.

14713890,Treatment of Wilson's disease with zinc. XVIII. Initial treatment of the hepatic decompensation presentation with trientine and zinc.,"Fred K Askari, Joel Greenson, Robert D Dick, Virginia D Johnson, George J Brewer","We have treated 9 patients who presented with hepatic decompensation resulting from Wilson's disease with a combination of trientine and zinc, generally for at least 4 months, followed by transition to zinc maintenance therapy. All of these patients had hypoalbuminemia, all but 1 had hyperbilirubinemia, and 7 had ascites. All of these patients would have been candidates for liver transplantation on the basis of their initial Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. The minimal listing criteria for transplant candidates is a score greater than 7. Eight of the 9 patients had demonstrated a CTP score of 10 or higher. The other scoring system that has been used in Wilson's disease to determine need for transplantation is the prognostic index of Nazer, in which a score over 6 indicates that the patient is unlikely to survive without a transplant if treated with penicillamine. Two of our patients had Nazer scores higher than 6. With our medical therapy, all 9 of these patients have recovered normal liver function as reflected by normalization of their CTP scores to 5. Because of coexisting neurologic disease, 1 of our 9 patients was initiated on a neurologic protocol and by chance randomized to receive tetrathiomolybdate (TM) and zinc after 2 weeks of trientine/zinc treatment. This patient's liver function recovered much more rapidly than did that of the other 8 patients, all of whom were treated with trientine/zinc, suggesting that TM therapy offers a further advantage. In summary, we were able to take 9 patients who presented with liver failure -8 of whom had CTP scores indicating a potential need for liver transplantation and 2 of whom had Nazer prognostic scores indicating that they were not likely to survive if treated only with penicillamine - and treat them medically, with recovery in all 9. We believe the trientine/zinc combination therapy should be the standard for initial treatment of liver failure in Wilson's disease because its efficacy is equal or slightly superior to that of penicillamine and because it has a much lower incidence of side effects. Moreover, TM warrants study to determine whether therapy for hepatic Wilson's disease can be further improved.",2003,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We hypothesized that mitochondria are a major target of copper-induced cytotoxicity in Wilson disease. We used the human hepatoma line Hep G2 to examine copper-mediated cytotoxicity and three different methods to assess organelle damage: MTT assay (mitochondria), neutral red (NR; lysosomes) and Trypan blue exclusion assay (TB; plasma membrane). For all assays, cells at approximately 60% confluence in microtitre plates were incubated with CuCl(2) (concentration range: 50-100-150-200 microM) for 24 or 48 h. Results were expressed as percent of untreated control. At 24 h, cytotoxicity as detected by NR assay was significantly higher at all concentrations of copper than for MTT or TB ( p<0.005 at all concentrations). Cytotoxicity as detected by MTT was higher than that detected by TB at all concentrations except at 200 microM (p<0.05 for 50 microM, p<0.005 for 100 microM, p = 0.001 for 150 microM). Results at 48 h were similar (NR versus others: p <0.001 MTT versus TB: NS except at 150 microM where p<0.01). We investigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in copper-associated hepatocytoxicity by incubating sub-confluent cells with 2('),7(')-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye plus copper (concentration range: 0-200 microM) for 1-1.5 h.

We report the clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and outcome with treatment of two septuagenarian siblings evaluated as part of a research trial for treatment of neurological WD. The index case was a 72-year-old woman who suffered progressive neurological disability, then developed sub-fulminant liver failure. Her sibling was a 70-year-old man with minimal neurological symptoms and a mild depressive disorder. His liver biopsy revealed only steatosis and minimal fibrosis and an elevated hepatic copper content (671 mug/g dry weight liver). Molecular studies demonstrated compound heterozygosity for disease specific ATP7B mutations E1064A and H1069Q in both patients. Both individuals were treated with trientine and Zn followed by Zn maintenance therapy. Over the last 5 years, the clinical course stabilized and improved, although the index case recently died from bronchopneumonia. In conclusion, advanced age and different clinical presentations of these two subjects with identical ATP7B mutations raises the question of the degree of penetrance for these and other ATP7B mutations.

Aside from the copper storage disease, Wilson's disease, recent attention has focused on the accumulation of zinc, copper and iron in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and the accumulation of iron in Parkinson's disease. In particular, the parenchymal deposition of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and its interaction with metal ions has been postulated to play a role in the progression of AD. Thus, the strategy of lowering brain metal ions and targeting the interaction of Abeta peptide and metal ions through the administration of chelators has merit. Our recent finding that nanoparticle delivery systems can cross the blood-brain barrier has led us to investigate whether chelators delivered conjugated to nanoparticles could act to reverse metal ion induced protein precipitation. In the present studies, the Cu (I) chelator D-penicillamine was covalently conjugated to nanoparticles via a disulfide bond or a thioether bond. Nanoparticle-chelator conjugates were stable between pH 6-8 in aqueous suspension if stored at 4 degrees C, and did not aggregate when challenged with salts and serum. Release of D-penicillamine from the nanoparticles was achieved using reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (as a model for glutathione). Nanoparticles treated only under reducing conditions that released the conjugated D-penicillamine were able to effectively resolubilize copper-Abeta (1-42) aggregates. These results indicate that nanoparticles have potential to deliver D-penicillamine to the brain for the prevention of Abeta (1-42) accumulation, as well as to reduce metal ion accumulation in other CNS diseases.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We compared the effects of three metal chelating agents, N-benzyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate (BGD), d-penicillamine (D-PEN), and triethylenetetramine (TETA), on the biliary and urinary excretions of Cu using LEC rats. The animals were treated ip with each chelating agent (1 mmol/kg body weight) and then the bile and urine samples were collected for 3 h. Because single treatment with BGD markedly stimulated biliary excretion of Cu, the protective effect of repeated BGD injection on spontaneous hepatocellular damage was further examined. Separate groups received two weekly injections of BGD starting at 11 weeks of age and were compared to saline-injected controls. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and bilirubin level were significantly increased in control LEC rats by 19 weeks of age and histopathological analysis demonstrated extensive hepatic damage in these rats. However, repeated BGD injections prevented the increases in serum ALT and bilirubin and blocked the histopathological changes in the liver. Furthermore, although Cu rapidly accumulated in the liver, kidney, spleen, and serum of control LEC rats during the test period, repeated BGD injection largely prevented these increases. These results indicate that BGD treatment is effective in blocking excessive Cu accumulation in LEC rats that, in turn, provides protection from spontaneous liver damage.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
15614251,Value of an enzymatic assay for the determination of serum ceruloplasmin.,"Georgina Macintyre, Klaus S Gutfreund, W R Wayne Martin, Richard Camicioli, Diane W Cox","The serum concentration of the copper protein ceruloplasmin has been an important diagnostic indicator of Wilson's disease (WD). It is widely quoted that 95% of people with WD have low serum ceruloplasmin concentrations. Current evidence suggests that a normal serum ceruloplasmin concentration is more common in patients with WD, particularly those with liver disease, perhaps in part because of the routine use of an immunologic assay. This assay might indicate a normal level of ceruloplasmin when the enzymatic activity is lower. Enzymatic activity is the biologically relevant parameter. We compared the immunologic measurement with the enzymatic assessment of oxidase activity in patients with liver or neurologic symptoms of unknown origin in whom WD was considered in the differential diagnosis. Although a strong correlation of ceruloplasmin protein concentration with oxidase activity was observed in controls, this was not the case for these patients. Twelve patients, presenting with various types of hepatic disease, demonstrated a weak correlation between ceruloplasmin protein concentration and oxidase activity. Ten percent of patients with neurologic symptoms ( n = 41) had low ceruloplasmin concentrations and oxidase activity, and another 8% had normal ceruloplasmin concentrations associated with low oxidase activity. Although the enzymatic method is preferred for its biologic relevance, ceruloplasmin analysis is not a reliable diagnostic parameter for the diagnosis of WD in patients with liver disease. An important use of the ceruloplasmin oxidase assay is in the follow-up of patients with WD. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity was undetectable in sera from patients with WD who were undergoing long-term chelation therapy, suggesting an early sign of copper depletion and a need for subsequent monitoring for symptoms of copper deficiency.",2004,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Erythrocytes are, together with kidney and liver, the main targets for copper toxicity. Here we report that both water and glycerol permeability of human AQP3 is inhibited by copper. Inhibition is fast, dose-dependent, and reversible. If copper is dissolved in carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer, the natural buffer system in our body, doses in the range of those observed in Wilson disease and in copper poisoning caused significant inhibition. AQP7, another aquaglyceroporin, was insensitive to copper. Three extracellular amino acid residues, Trp128, Ser152, and His241, were identified as responsible for the effect of copper on AQP3. We have previously shown that Ser152 is involved in regulation of AQP3 by pH. The fact that Ser152 mediates regulation of AQP3 by copper may explain the phenomenon of exquisite sensitivity of human erythrocytes to copper at acidic pH. When AQP3 was co-expressed with another AQP, only glycerol but not water permeability was inhibited by copper.

15892619,Copper lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate as an antiangiogenic strategy in cancer.,George J Brewer,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a novel anticopper agent under development for use in Wilson's disease. It acts by forming a stable tripartite complex with serum albumin and copper, rendering the complexed copper unavailable for cellular uptake. TM is a very potent anticopper agent and has an excellent safety profile. It has been shown that normal copper levels are required for optimal angiogenesis. Based on this background, we decided to evaluate TM as an anticancer agent. TM treatment of Her/2neu mice, genetically programmed to develop breast cancer, completely prevented the development of visible mammary cancers, although avascular microscopic clusters of cancer cells were present in the breasts of TM treated animals. Controls developed grossly visible tumors. TM was able to strongly inhibit tumor growth in six other rodent models. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial of advanced and metastatic cancers, freedom from progression averaged 11 months, and some individual results were quite dramatic. Eight phase 2 studies of specific cancers have been launched. TM's hypothesized mechanism of action is inhibition of angiogenic cytokines. Unlike other current approaches to antiangiogenic therapy which target single agents, we hypothesize that TM inhibits multiple angiogenic cytokines. Part of this effect appears to stem from inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF(K)B), which in turn controls transcription of many angiogenic and other cytokines. However, there are probably multiple mechanisms, in that some angiogenic cytokines appear to have separate mechanisms of copper dependence. The inhibition of multiple angiogenic cytokines gives TM the potential to be a more global inhibitor of angiogenesis.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The NH(2)-terminal domain ( approximately 70 kDa), which contains six copies of the heavy metal-associated repeat GMT/HCXXC, is also able to bind zinc. We have used circular dichroism (CD) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to characterize zinc binding to the NH(2)-terminal metal-binding domain. These studies have revealed that zinc is able to bind to this domain with a stoichiometry of 6:1, and upon binding, induces conformational changes in the NH(2)-terminal domain. These conformational changes are completely different from those previously observed for copper binding to the domain and lead to an overall loss of secondary structure in the domain. The XAS spectra indicate that zinc is ligated primarily by nitrogen atoms and therefore has low affinity for the heavy metal-associated repeats where copper has been shown to bind. The differences between zinc and copper binding may serve as the basis for the metal-ion mediated regulation of the ATPase in vivo.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We are interested in nonmetal chemicals that may alter intestinal copper metabolism and thus help to alleviate copper toxicity. Previously, we have shown that quercetin, a dietary flavonoid, can chelate copper. This study further examined the interaction of quercetin and copper in intestinal epithelial cells. We found that quercetin enhanced metallothoinein induction by copper and the effect was dose dependent. Quercetin also exerted a cumulative effect after repeated exposure. Repeated low-dose treatment (3-10 microM) of cells with quercetin can lead to the same effect on metallothoinein as one higher concentration treatment (100 microM). This property of quercetin is distinct from its chemical interaction with copper, but both can contribute to a reduction of copper toxicity. Among other flavonoids tested, two other copper chelators, catechin and rutin, did not increase copper induction of metallothionein, whereas genistein, an isoflavone that does not interact with copper chemically, increased copper induction of metallothionein. The effect of quercetin on copper metabolism is unique. Quercetin decreased zinc-stimulated metallothionein expression and had no effect on the cadmium induction of metallothionein.

Zinc acetate has been approved by the US FDA for maintenance therapy of adult and paediatric Wilson's disease patients but also has efficacy in the treatment of pregnant patients and presymptomatic patients from the beginning. It also has value as adjunctive therapy for the initial treatment of symptomatic patients. Zinc's mechanism of action involves induction of intestinal cell metallothionein (Mt), which blocks copper absorption from the intestinal track. A negative copper balance is caused by blockade not only of absorption of food copper but the blockade of reabsorption of the considerable amount of endogenously secreted copper in saliva, gastric juice and intestinal secretions. Zinc is completely effective in controlling copper levels and toxicity in Wilson's disease, as are other anticopper agents. Zinc's major advantage over other anticopper agents is its extremely low level of toxicity. The only side effect is some degree of initial gastric irritation in approximately10% of patients, which usually decreases and becomes insignificant over time. As with all long-term therapies, compliance is a problem in some patients and dictates regular monitoring with 24 h urine copper and zinc measurements. As with all anticopper therapies, over a long period of time, overtreatment and induction of copper deficiency can occur.

P1-type ATPases have a distinctive amino-terminal domain containing the conserved metal-binding motif GXXCXXC. ZntA has one copy of this motif while ATP7B has six copies. The effect of interchanging the amino-terminal domains of ATP7B and ZntA was investigated. Chimeric proteins were constructed in which either the entire amino-terminal domain of ATP7B or only its sixth metal-binding motif replaced the amino-terminal domain of ZntA. Both chimeras conferred resistance to lead, zinc, and cadmium salts but not to copper salts. The purified chimeras displayed activity with lead, cadmium, zinc, and mercury, which are substrates of ZntA. There was no activity with copper or silver, which are substrates of ATP7B. The chimeras were 2-3-fold less active than ZntA. Thus, the amino-terminal domain of P1-type ATPases cannot alter the metal specificity determined by the transmembrane segment.

In this study, we sought to evaluate tissue levels of glutathione and cysteine, an important detoxification system, and of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipoperoxidation, in patients with Wilson's disease receiving penicillamine or zinc treatment, in comparison with patients with chronic liver disease of different origin. Concentrations of cysteine, reduced/oxidized glutathione, malondialdehyde, zinc, and copper were determined (with the use of high-pressure liquid chromatography, fluorimetry and atomic-absorption spectrophotometry) in liver-biopsy specimens from 24 patients with Wilson's disease (18 treated with zinc, 6 with penicillamine), 34 patients with chronic viral hepatitis, and 10 patients with alcoholic liver disease.

Malondialdehyde levels were low, but when zinc- and penicillamine-treated patients were considered separately, only the former had low malondialdehyde levels. Zinc-treated patients had higher concentrations of reduced glutathione and a lower percentage of oxidized glutathione.

However, due to the difficulty and expense of producing large quantities of a recombinant protein, Entremed Inc. has experienced financial difficulties [3]. As this company's fate indicates, a drug must not only be clinically effective, but must also possess reasonable production economics. Another interesting component of compound development is selectivity. Highly selective antiangiogenic compounds such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU-5416 are being replaced by less selective compounds such as SU-6668, which acts on a broader spectrum of tyrosine kinase receptors [4]. This move towards using less selective antiangiogenic compounds is based on preclinical models that demonstrate both better clinical efficacy when using less specific molecules and low response rates from the more selective compounds. With the aim of further examining broadly-acting antiangiogenic agents, the authors are currently evaluating new classes of agents that preferentially bind copper and inhibit angiogenesis. Copper has been known to be a significant target for antiangiogenic therapy for a number of years [5]. Recently, through the use of molecular techniques, the target enzymes that utilise copper as a cofactor are being elucidated. This review will describe the historical use of anticopper therapy for the treatment of Wilson's disease and evaluate some of the new anticopper compounds currently under consideration for use in antiangiogenic therapy.",2003,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Because of its rapid action, potency, and safety, TM is proving to be a very effective drug for initial treatment of acutely ill Wilson's disease patients. Beyond this, TM has antiangiogenic effects, because many proangiogenic cytokines require normal levels of copper. This has led to use of TM in cancer, where it is generally effective in animal tumor models, and has shown efficacy in preliminary clinical studies. Most recently, it has been found that TM has antifibrotic and antiinflammatory effects through inhibition of profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines.",2003,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Liver lysosomes from tetrathiomolybdate-treated LEC rats were isolated and analyzed by Cu and Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The lysosomes contained a Cu-Mo-S cluster in which the Mo is coordinated by four sulfurs at 2.24 A with approximately three copper neighbors at 2.70 A. Each Cu is coordinated to 3-4 sulfurs at 2.28 A with approximately one Mo neighbor at 2.70 A.

12443926,"Transport and detoxification systems for transition metals, heavy metals and metalloids in eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes.",Barry P Rosen,"Transition metals, heavy metals and metalloids are usually toxic in excess, but a number of transition metals are essential trace elements. In all cells there are mechanisms for metal ion homeostasis that frequently involve a balance between uptake and efflux systems. This review will briefly describe ATP-coupled resistance pumps. ZntA and CadA are bacterial P-type ATPases that confers resistance to Zn(II), Cd(II) and Pb(II). Homologous copper pumps include the Menkes and Wilson disease proteins and CopA, an Escherichia coli pump that confers resistance to Cu(I). For resistance to arsenicals and antimonials there are several different families of transporters. In E. coli the ArsAB ATPase is a novel system that confers resistance to As(III) and Sb(III). Eukaryotic arsenic resistance transporters include Acr3p and Ycf1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These systems provide resistance to arsenite [As(III)]. Arsenate [As(V)] detoxification involves reduction of As(V) to As(III), a process catalyzed by arsenate reductase enzymes. There are three families of arsenate reductases, two found in bacterial systems and a third identified in S. cerevisiae.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
12426114,Molecular mechanism of copper transport in Wilson disease.,"Negah Fatemi, Bibudhendra Sarkar","Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The Wilson disease protein is a putative copper-transporting P-type ATPase, ATP7B, whose malfunction results in the toxic accumulation of copper in the liver and brain, causing the hepatic and/or neurological symptoms accompanying this disease. The cytosolic N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kDa) of this ATPase comprises six heavy metal-associated domains, each of which contains the conserved metal-binding motif GMTCXXC. The N-terminal domain (Wilson disease copper-binding domain [WCBD]) has been expressed, purified, and characterized using various techniques. The WCBD binds six atoms of copper in the +1 oxidation state competitively, and with a greater affinity than all other metals. The copper atom is coordinated by two cysteines in a distorted linear geometry. Copper binds the WCBD in a cooperative manner and induces secondary and tertiary conformation changes. Zinc binding to the WCBD has also been characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and shown to produce conformational changes that are completely different from those induced by copper. The phosphorylation/nucleotide-binding domain of ATP7B has also been expressed and characterized and shown to be capable of binding ATP but lacking ATPase activity. A peptide corresponding to the sixth transmembrane domain of ATP7B has been constructed and shown to undergo secondary conformational changes upon binding a single atom of copper. Finally, a chimeric protein consisting of the WCBD and truncated ZntA, a zinc-transporting ATPase lacking the N-terminal domain, has been constructed and analyzed for metal ion selectivity. These results suggest that the core determines the metal ion specificity of P-type ATPases, and the N-terminal metal-binding domain may play a regulatory role.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
12420912,Wilson's disease.,"Anand Pandit, Ashish Bavdekar, Sheila Bhave","Wilson's disease (WD), an inborn error of copper (Cu) metabolism, is now one of the leading liver diseases in children in India. The clinical presentation can be extremely varied viz.,--all forms of acute and chronic liver disease, minimal to severe neurological disease, psychiatric problems, bony deformities, hemolytic anemia and endocrine manifestations. A high index of suspicion is necessary along with a judicious battery of investigations for diagnosis. Hepatic copper estimation is the most reliable test but is not easily available in India. Liver biopsy may not be possible because of bleeding problems and histological features are often not diagnostic of WD. In the absence of hepatic Cu, a low ceruloplasmin, high 24 hour urinary copper and presence of KF rings aid in making the diagnosis. The mainstay of initial therapy is Cu-chelators like D-Penicillamine, and Trientine for reduction in body copper to sub-toxic levels. Subsequent maintenance therapy is necessarily lifelong with D-Penicillamine, Trientine or Zinc. Children on therapy must be monitored regularly for response, side-effects, compliance and rehabilitation. Response to therapy may be unpredictable, but acute and early presentations like fulminant hepatic failures have a poor outcome. All siblings must be screened for WD as early diagnosis and treatment result in a good outcome. The identification of the WD gene on chromosome 13 has led to the possible use of molecular genetics (haplotype and mutational analyses) in the diagnosis of WD. Parent groups/associations must take active part in holistic management of WD.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the gene ATP7B leading to toxic copper accumulation in the liver and other organs such as brain, kidney and cornea. Measurements were performed by 125I-radioimmunoassay. Neither sex differences nor correlation between plasma nociceptin levels and liver function test results were found. It is suggested that elevated plasma nociceptin level found in Wilson disease patients is due to inhibition of nociceptin-inactivating Zn-metallopeptidases (aminopeptidase N (APN) and endopeptidase 24.15) by the toxic copper deposits in liver and/or brain.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
12095159,Zinc inhibits the nuclear translocation of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and protects cultured human neurons from copper-induced neurotoxicity.,"Jacob W VanLandingham, Cheryl A Fitch, Cathy W Levenson","High concentrations of the trace metal zinc (Zn) have previously been shown to provide transient protection of cells from apoptotic death. The molecular mechanisms responsible for this protection are not known. Thus, this work explored the ability of Zn to protect human neurons in culture (NT2-N) from Cu-mediated death and tested the hypotheses that the tumor-suppressor protein p53 plays a role in Cu-induced neuronal death and is part of the mechanism of Zn protection. Copper toxicity (100 microM) resulted in significant apoptotic neuronal death by 12 h. Addition of 100 microM Zn to Cu-treated cells increased neuronal death. However, the addition of 700 microM Zn to Cu-treated cells resulted in neuronal viability that was not different from untreated controls through 24 h. p53 mRNA abundance, while increased by the addition of Cu and 100 microM Zn, was decreased to 50% of control with the addition of 500 microM Zn in Cu-treated cells, and to 10% of control with 700 microM Zn. Consistent with its role as a transcription factor, both Western analysis and immunocytochemistry showed significant increases in nuclear p53 protein levels in Cu toxicity. The role of p53 in Cu-mediated apoptosis was further confirmed by elimination of apoptosis in Cu-treated cells that had been transfected with a dominant-negative p53 construct to prevent p53 expression. Furthermore, the addition of 500-700 microM Zn prevented the movement of p53 into the nucleus suggesting that Zn not only protects neurons from Cu toxicity by regulating p53 mRNA abundance but also by preventing the translocation of p53 to the nucleus.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The prevalence of MWS is currently unknown, but 171 patients have been reported so far. It seems probable that MWS is under-diagnosed, particularly in patients without HSCR. MWS is caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions in the Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 gene, ZEB2, previously called ZFHX1B (SIP1). To date, over 100 deletions/mutations have been reported in patients with a typical phenotype; they are frequently whole gene deletions or truncating mutations, suggesting that haploinsufficiency is the main pathological mechanism. Studies of genotype-phenotype analysis show that facial gestalt and delayed psychomotor development are constant clinical features, while the frequent and severe congenital malformations are variable. In a small number of patients, unusual mutations can lead to an atypical phenotype. The facial phenotype is particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark warranting ZEB2 mutational analysis, even in the absence of HSCR. The majority of MWS cases reported so far were sporadic, therefore the recurrence risk is low. Nevertheless, rare cases of sibling recurrence have been observed. Congenital malformations and seizures require precocious clinical investigation with intervention of several specialists (including neonatologists and pediatricians).

The prevalence of primary haemochromatosis is approximately 0.5%, about 200 times higher than the prevalence of Wilson's disease. The two diseases are characterized by homozygous occurrences of mutations in the HFE gene on chromosome 6 (primary haemochromatosis) and the ATP7B gene on chromosome 13 (Wilson's disease). Unlike most other inherited conditions, these diseases can be successfully treated, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. Serum ferritin values, transferrin saturation and genetic analysis are used when diagnosing haemochromatosis. The diagnostics of Wilson's disease depends on the use of urinary copper values, serum ceruloplasmin and liver biopsy. If untreated, both of these genetic diseases result in rapidly progressing multiorgan damage and early death. The key treatment for haemochromatosis is phlebotomy, for Wilson's disease chelation or Zn treatment. Although the present treatments considerably improve the prognosis of patients, they may be inadequate in patients diagnosed so late that extensive body deposits of metal have been developed.

A 17-year-old boy presented with numerous episodes of hypokalemic weakness of the lower limbs of undetermined etiology since 12 years of age. Clinically, lower-motor neuron type of weakness of the limbs with preserved reflexes and paucity of sensory abnormalities were prominent. The investigations revealed distal renal tubular acidosis, hepatitis, and bilateral Kayser-Fleischer ring. The diagnosis of Wilson disease was confirmed by the demonstration of low serum ceruloplasmin, high serum copper, and high urinary copper excretion per se and after penicillamine challenge.

19026449,Reactivity and kinetic studies of (NH4)2(MoS4) in acidic aqueous solution: possible relevance to the angiostatic function of the MoS4(2-) ligand.,"E K Quagraine, I Georgakaki, D Coucouvanis","Although addition of mineral acids to WS(4)(2-) in water is known to lead to aggregation and formation of various polynuclear thiotungstate anions, acid hydrolysis of the MoS(4)(2-) anion is reported to give mainly MoS(3) or MoS(2) as hydrolysis products. Knowledge of the resulting product(s) from such reactions has implications on the use of tetrathiomolybdate (MoS(4)(2-)) as both a potential anti-tumor drug and for the treatment of Wilson's disease. In this investigation, reaction of HCl with MoS(4)(2-) in water was monitored as a function of time. Reaction mixtures of both 1:1 and 2:1 mole ratios of the acid to MoS(4)(2-) were examined, as well as MoS(4)(2-) reactions in simulated human stomach fluids at pH of approximately 2 and 3. Monitoring by electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and UV-visible spectroscopy clearly has revealed the formation of complex mixtures of polynuclear thiomolybdates (Mo(2)-Mo(18)). Generally, a two-stage consecutive reaction sequence occurs. A faster stage (k=7.0-7.9 x 10(-2)min(-1)), which seems to extend to trinuclear thiomolybdate species, followed by a slower second stage (k=5.4-15.2 x 10(-4)min(-1)) to higher polynuclear thiomolybdates. Under acidic conditions (e.g. pH approximately 3) that could also mimic some human stomach fluids, and under anaerobic atmosphere where the generated hydrogen sulfide is prevented from escaping from the reaction vessel, Mo(3)S(9)(2-) predominates over an extended reaction period. In similar reactions under aerobic conditions and where the hydrogen sulfide is irretrievably lost from the reaction mixture the binuclear (Mo(2)O(a)S(10-a)(2-);a=0-3) and trinuclear (Mo(3)O(b)S(9-b)(2-);b=1-3) anions predominate.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The drug, from the University of Michigan was licensed to Pipex Pharmaceuticals Inc for development for several indications; development of the drug for cancer was later licensed to Attenuon LLC. In a phase III clinical trial, TTM stabilized neurological function in patients with Wilson disease, causing significant recovery in 81% of patients at 3 years post initiation of therapy; a second phase III trial was ongoing at the time of publication. A phase I/II clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of TTM in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and led the FDA to grant TTM Orphan Drug status for this disease. Several phase II clinical trials had also been completed in patients with various cancers, and revealed mixed efficacy. TTM was also assessed in a phase I clinical trial for age-related macular degeneration, but the results reported from the trial were negative; no further development has occurred for this indication. TTM was assessed for the treatment of psoriasis in a phase II clinical trial, but no data have been reported. At the time of publication, phase II and phase III clinical trials were ongoing in patients with Alzheimer's disease and primary biliary cirrhosis, respectively. The most common clinical side effects observed for TTM over the range of indications have been anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia and transaminase elevations. These side effects were generally resolved with either a dose adjustment or temporary suspension of the dosing regimen.

18568852,Diagnosis of Wilson's disease: a comprehensive review.,"Chloe M Mak, Ching-Wan Lam","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The culprit gene is ATP7B. The worldwide prevalence is about 1 in 30,000, which may vary by population. Higher prevalence rates were reported using more sensitive screening techniques and pilot population screening. Typical presentations include neuropsychiatric and hepatic dysfunction, whereas atypical presentations are protean. Diagnosis relies on a high clinical suspicion, typical neurological symptoms, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and reduced serum ceruloplasmin concentration. The conventional value of < 0.20 g/l is not a universal diagnostic value. Age of the subjects and analytical variations should be considered when interpreting these levels. Patients with inconclusive findings require further investigations such as 24 h urinary free-copper excretion, penicillamine challenge test, liver copper measurement, and detection of gene mutations. Direct molecular diagnosis remains the most decisive tool. Other tests such as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper are unreliable. Potential pitfalls and limitations of these diagnostic markers are critically reviewed in this paper. The mainstays of therapy are trientine, penicillamine, and/or zinc. Liver transplantation is lifesaving for those with advanced disease. Ceruloplasmin oxidase activity and serum free-copper concentration should be monitored in patients on long-term de-coppering therapy to prevent iatrogenic copper deficiency.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

During this observation period, 6 neurological and 9 hepatic patients improved, while 2 neurological patients deteriorated. The pretreatment (1)H-MRS analysis showed a statistically significant lower level of mI/Cr, NAA/Cr, and higher Lip/Cr in all WD patients with improvement compared with controls. In patients with hepatic signs, a statistically significant increase of mI/Cr and Glx/Cr was observed in the second (1 year posttreatment) (1)H-MRS.

The aim of the study was to document the clinical and laboratory parameters of hepatic presentation of Wilson's disease in children. The study was conducted at a tertiary-care hospital in a developing country. Clinical and common laboratory parameters were recorded in 32 Wilson's disease children with hepatic presentation. The diagnosis was based on positive family history, Kayser-Fleischer ring, low serum ceruloplasmin level, elevated basal urinary copper excretion and favorable response to therapy with D-penicillamine.

16466879,Paradigm shift in treatment of Wilson's disease: zinc therapy now treatment of choice.,Tjaard Ubbo Hoogenraad,"Zinc therapy has replaced penicillamine as first-line therapy for Wilson's disease. New guidelines reflect the paradigm shift in treatment that has occurred in recent years. In the old paradigm, Wilson's disease was seen as genetic disorder associated with the accumulation of copper in the liver and in other organs once the liver had become overloaded with copper. When left untreated, the disease was regarded as uniformly fatal. The old treatment guidelines advised, 'decoppering' with penicillamine because this chelating agent was considered effective in restoring most patients to health. Before the start of treatment, patients were warned that their symptoms could worsen during the first weeks or months of therapy, so as to prevent them from abandoning penicillamine therapy in dismay. In the new paradigm, Wilson's disease is seen as a hereditary disorder associated with copper intoxication. The essence of symptomatic Wilson's disease is poisoning by free copper in the blood, that is, by copper that is not bound to ceruloplasmin. This form of copper is toxic, whereas accumulated copper and copper that is bound to ceruloplasmin or metallothionein is not. The treatment of symptomatic Wilson's disease is no longer aimed at 'decoppering', the removal of accumulated copper, but at the normalization of the free copper concentration in blood, to reverse the copper poisoning. This can be achieved safely and effectively with zinc therapy. Zinc induces metallothionein, a highly effective detoxification protein that binds copper. Oral zinc therapy leads to storage of metallothionein-bound copper in the mucosa of the gut and to the excretion of copper via the stools. New treatment guidelines advise against the use of chelating agents as initial treatment because they may aggravate copper intoxication and cause iatrogenic deterioration.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Forty eligible patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme began radiation therapy (6000 cGy in 30 fractions) in conjunction with a low-copper diet and escalating doses of penicillamine. Serum copper was measured at baseline and monthly. The primary end point of this study was overall survival compared to historical controls within the NABTT CNS Consortium database. The 25 males and 15 females who were enrolled had a median age of 54 years and a median Karnofsky performance status of 90. Surgical resection was performed in 83% of these patients.

16039066,Inhibition kinetics of mushroom tyrosinase by copper-chelating ammonium tetrathiomolybdate.,"Kyung-Hee Park, Yong-Doo Park, Jae-Rin Lee, Hwa-Sun Hahn, Sang-Jin Lee, Chang-Dae Bae, Jun-Mo Yang, Dong-Eun Kim, Myong-Joon Hahn","With a strategy of chelating coppers at tyrosinase active site to detect an effective inhibitor, several copper-specific chelators were applied in this study. Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate (ATTM) among them, known as a drug for treating Wilson's disease, turned out to be a significant tyrosinase inhibitor. Treatment with ATTM on mushroom tyrosinase completely inactivated enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Progress-of-substrate reaction kinetics using the two-step kinetic pathway and dilution of the ATTM revealed that ATTM is a tight-binding inhibitor and high dose of ATTM irreversibly inactivated tyrosinase. Progress-of-substrate reaction kinetics and activity restoration with a dilution of the ATTM indicated that the copper-chelating ATTM may bind slowly but reversibly to the active site without competition with substrate, and the enzyme-ATTM complex subsequently undergoes reversible conformational change, leading to complete inactivation of the tyrosinase activity. Thus, inhibition by ATTM on tyrosinase could be categorized as complexing type of inhibition with a slow and reversible binding. Detailed analysis of inhibition kinetics provided IC50 at the steady-state and inhibitor binding constant (K(I)) for ATTM as 1.0+/-0.2 microM and 10.65 microM, respectively. Our results may provide useful information regarding effective inhibitor of tyrosinase as whitening agents in the cosmetic industry.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Each type and stage of the disease can be considered as a therapeutic target, for which specialised therapy is appropriate. This paper systematically reviews the various types and stages of Wilson's disease presentation, and provides opinion on the appropriate therapy for each. For patients presenting with neurological disease, the use of tetrathiomolybdate is optimum; for patients presenting with mild-to-moderate hepatic failure, a combination of trientine (Syprine, Merck) and zinc is recommended, whereas liver transplantation is necessary for those with severe failure; zinc therapy alone or trientine alone as second choice is recommended for patients presenting with hepatitis or cirrhosis without liver failure, for maintenance therapy, for treatment of presymptomatic patients and for treatment of paediatric and pregnant patients.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Furthermore, such diseases may themselves cause seizures. Reduced renal function and hypoalbuminemia lead to accumulation of renally excreted AEDs, such as gabapentin, vigabatrin, topiramate, levetiracetam, and phenytoin. Valproate, lamotrigine, and benzodiazepines are less affected. Low protein-bound AEDs are extensively removed by hemodialysis and supplemental doses are required for dialysis patients. Uremia and related conditions, including intracranial hemorrhage, glucose and electrolyte imbalances, and concomitant drug use, can cause seizures, as can dialysis encephalopathy, primary cerebral lymphoma, fungal infections, and immunosuppressant toxicity in renal transplant recipients. Hepatic dysfunction reduces enzymatic metabolism of AEDs and causes hypoalbuminemia. Gabapentin, topiramate, and levetiracetam are preferred in these conditions, whereas conversely valproate and felbamate are potentially hepatotoxic and should be avoided. Seizures related to hepatic encephalopathy are controlled by oral lactulose or neomycin. Porphyria sufferers may benefit from gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam. Seizures in Wilson's disease may derive from d-penicillamine-induced pyridoxine deficiency. Effective treatment of seizures in renal and hepatic diseases requires attention to changes in AED pharmacokinetics and adequate care of the underlying illnesses.

16932613,Wilson's disease: an update.,"Shyamal K Das, Kunal Ray","Wilson's disease (WD) is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation to the copper-transporting gene ATP7B. The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain. Diagnosis of the condition depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along the entire 21 exons, which makes the identification of gene defects particularly challenging. Identification of carriers and presymptomatic family members of affected individuals is achieved by polymerase-chain-reaction-based marker analysis. The traditional treatment for WD is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine, but use of this drug has been questioned because of reported side effects. The use of agents such as trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate has been advocated, although results of long-term trials are awaited. In selected cases, orthotropic hepatic transplantation can reverse the basic metabolic abnormality in WD and improve both hepatic and neurological symptoms. Studies of the underlying defects in ATP7B and its suspected modifiers ATOX1 and COMMD1 are expected to unravel the disease's genotype-phenotype correlation, and should lead to the design of improved drugs for ameliorating the suffering of patients.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Here, a 45-kDa isoform of PLZF without a BTB domain was identified via yeast two-hybrid screening using the C-terminal region of ATP7B as bait in our determination of the biological roles of the Wilson disease protein outside of its copper-binding domain. Our immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the hepatocytic isoform of PLZF could specifically interact with the C-terminal region of ATP7B. The immunostaining of HepG2 cells revealed that the ATP7B and PLZF proteins were apparently colocalized into the trans-Golgi complexes. It was also determined that disruption of PLZF expression in the HepG2 cells affected an attenuation of ERK activity in a dose-dependent manner. The hepatocytic activities of ERK kinase were found to be enhanced as the result of PLZF or ATP7B expression, but this enhancement was abrogated by the deletion of the C-terminal region of ATP7B. Furthermore, a transgenic Drosophila strain that ectopically expressed the hepatocytic deltaBTB-PLZF exhibited phenotypic changes in eye and wing development, and these alterations were fully recovered as the result of ATP7B expression, indicating the obvious in vivo interaction between the two proteins. Those PLZF-induced abnormalities were attributed to the enhancement of ERK signaling, as was shown by phenotypic reversions with loss-of-function mutations in ERK signal transduction in Drosophila. These data suggest the existence of a mechanism that regulates ERK signaling via the C-terminus of ATP7B and the ATP7B-interacting hepatocytic PLZF.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Strikingly, the total serum copper concentration is always low in WD, even though the non-ceruloplasmin copper level is still expected to be high. To assess the role of free radical reactions catalyzed by non-ceruloplasmin copper, we investigated erythrocyte metabolism and oxidative stress as a mechanism for hemolysis in eight WD patients during episodes of acute hemolysis and compared them with eight follow-up cases of WD on d-penicillamine therapy and eight healthy, age-matched children. Elevated levels of non-ceruloplasmin copper were found in all the WD patients during an episode of hemolytic anemia. There was marked inhibition in erythrocyte enzymes, namely, hexokinase, total adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) from WD patients compared with patients on penicillamine and healthy children, indicating altered erythrocyte metabolism during a hemolytic crisis. Antioxidant status was also found to be compromised as is evident from decreased glutathione (GSH) levels, decreased antioxidant enzymes (namely, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase), increased lipid peroxidation, and deranged plasma antioxidants. Uric acid showed maximum decrease followed by ascorbic acid. These findings suggest that the free radical production by elevated non-ceruloplasmin copper through transition metal catalyzed reactions leads to oxidative injury resulting in altered erythrocyte metabolism and severely compromised antioxidant status of WD patients during hemolytic anemia.",2006,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

7552582,Wilson's disease: a new gene and an animal model for an old disease.,J A Cuthbert,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive, inherited disorder of copper metabolism. In normal individuals, copper homeostasis is controlled by the balance between intestinal absorption of dietary copper and hepatic excretion of excess copper in bile. In Wilson's disease, hepatic copper is neither excreted in bile nor incorporated into ceruloplasmin and copper accumulates to toxic levels. The Wilson's disease gene (WND) encodes a putative copper-transporting protein that is expressed almost exclusively in the liver. The predicted structure of the protein product is that of a P-type ATPase with striking homology to bacterial copper transporters and the gene product of another inherited disorder of copper metabolism, Menkes' disease. A rat model of Wilson's disease has recently been identified. The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat manifests elevated hepatic copper, defective incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin, and reduced biliary excretion of copper. The rat homologue of the WND is abnormal in LEC rats. Clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease arise directly from copper-induced damage to hepatocytes (hepatic presentation) or indirectly after the release of copper from the liver with subsequent damage to the brain (neuropsychiatric presentation) and other organs. Genetic heterogeneity (different mutations in a single gene) may account for some of the variability in Wilsonian presentations. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on the demonstration of disordered copper metabolism, manifested as elevated urinary and hepatic copper and low ceruloplasmin levels. However, none of the abnormal findings in Wilson's disease is pathognomonic. Genetic diagnosis, in the absence of family studies, is likely to be difficult since many different mutations result in the disease. Management of Wilson's disease involves decreasing excess levels of copper accumulated in the liver, brain, and other organs. Copper chelation therapy, to increase urinary excretion of copper, is the mainstay of treatment. In addition, oral zinc therapy may be useful at decreasing absorption of dietary copper and rendering tissue copper nontoxic, by increasing the formation of complexes with copper-binding proteins. Liver transplantation can be necessary for individuals with acute hepatic failure or complications of cirrhosis.

The girl was clinically free of disease and had no conventional biochemical markers of Wilson's disease (i.e., normal ceruloplasmin, normal copper in the serum, normal 24-hour urinary copper excretion). Diagnosis with restriction fragment length polymorphisms and a nonradioactive polymerase chain reaction-based analysis with microsatellite markers showed her to be homozygous for the disease-associated markers. A liver biopsy was performed, and a 20-fold increased liver copper content confirmed the diagnosis. The child was treated with chelation therapy with D-penicillamine. The report of this study clearly shows the advantage of DNA linkage analysis (especially polymerase chain reaction) over conventional laboratory methods for presymptomatic diagnosis of Wilson's disease before irreparable liver and neurological damage occurs. The only limitation of this DNA-based diagnosis is the fact that it is only applicable in siblings of an index patient whose diagnosis was made by phenotypic criteria.",1995,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Before treatment, specific 11C-raclopride binding (only patient 1) was markedly reduced, with a putamen to cerebellum ratio of 1.99 (controls: 3.99 +/- 0.55, n = 15) and a caudate to cerebellum ratio of 2.52 (controls: 3.65 +/- 0.59, n = 15). Specific 123I-IBZM binding was reduced in both patients, with a basal ganglia to frontal cortex ratio of 1.25 (patient 1) and of 1.41 (patient 2) controls: 1.57 +/- 0.04, n = 5). After 4 months of therapy, 11C-raclopride-PET improved to a putamen to cerebellum ratio of 2.52 and a caudate to cerebellum ratio of 3.06 (patient 1). 123I-IBZM-SPECT revealed an increase of basal ganglia to frontal cortex ratios of 1.34 (patient 1) and 1.55 (patient 2). On heavily T2-weighted MRI sequences, hyperintense signal changes before therapy within the putamen (both patients), brainstem (only patient 1), and caudate (only patient 2) greatly diminished after treatment.

Thorough evaluation of emotionally disturbed persons, including complete history taking, careful physical examination, and appropriate laboratory profile, generally rules out or arouses suspicion of Wilson's disease during routine screening. Laboratory abnormalities necessitate repeated studies and additional family and personal history taking with emphasis on possible Wilson's disease. Further workup may then be indicated.

XIII: Therapy with zinc in presymptomatic patients from the time of diagnosis.,"G J Brewer, R D Dick, V Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V Johnson, Y Wang","The siblings of patients with newly diagnosed Wilson's disease are each at 25% risk of also having this autosomal recessive disease. Screening these siblings allows their detection and institution of prophylactic therapy before they become clinically ill. Herein we report the successful treatment of 13 presymptomatic patients with zinc acetate. These patients who received zinc have been followed for 3 to 9 years. In well-complying patients, 24-hour urine copper and non-ceruloplasmin plasma copper levels have decreased over years of follow-up, consistent with the elimination of the excess easily mobilized copper (the potentially toxic copper) of the body. Effect of therapy and compliance are easily monitored by following 24-hour urine zinc and copper levels. The urine copper level is a good reflection of the body's excess load of easily mobilizable copper. It will increase if control is not adequate. A decrease in urine zinc is an early signal that the patient's compliance is not optimal. The levels of hepatic copper in response to several years of zinc therapy may remain the same, go down, or go up temporarily. This is a reflection of zinc induction of hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters copper in a non-toxic pool. Hepatic copper levels should not be used to manage therapy. Liver function is well preserved by zinc therapy, and no zinc toxicity occurred in these 13 patients. No patient developed symptoms related to Wilson's disease. We conclude that zinc acetate is a fully effective and non-toxic therapy for the prophylactic treatment of the presymptomatic Wilson's disease patient.",1994,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

7840659,Hydroxyl radical formation from cuprous ion and hydrogen peroxide: a spin-trapping study.,"M R Gunther, P M Hanna, R P Mason, M S Cohen","Copper toxicity has been presumed to involve catalytic hydroxyl radical (.OH) formation from hydrogen peroxide. Addition of Cu1+ to a solution containing ethanol or dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and the spin-trapping agent alpha-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (4-POBN) results in formation of the alpha-hydroxyethyl radical or methyl radical adduct of 4-POBN, respectively. Adduct formation was prevented by inclusion of catalase, but not by superoxide dismutase. Inclusion of exogenous H2O2 in the reaction mixture increased the yield of ethanol- or Me2SO-derived radical adduct and also enhanced the formation of secondary radical adducts, including 4-POBN/.H and the methyl radical adduct of 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. The alpha-hydroxyethyl adduct of 4-POBN is rapidly decomposed in the presence of copper, but not iron salts, whereas the methyl radical adduct is relatively stable in the presence of inorganic copper. The total concentration of radical adduct detected from the reaction between Cu1+ and H2O2, determined by comparison of the integrated spectral intensity with that of the stable 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy free radical, was only 1-5% of the maximum amount predicted assuming radical adduct formation from all of the added copper. A variety of copper chelators inhibit formation of carbon-centered radical adducts of 4-POBN, including penicillamine and triethylenetetramine, which are the primary drugs used to treat the copper metabolism disorder Wilson's disease. The results provide clear evidence for hydroxyl radical formation from Cu1+ and H2O2 (either added or formed during the autoxidation of reduced copper.",1995,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

We have developed zinc as a lifelong therapy for patients with Wilson's disease. Interference with lymphocyte function occurring as a side effect of zinc therapy could produce serious problems in our patients. We evaluated lymphocyte mitogenic response and natural killer cell activity in patients with Wilson's disease treated for 5 years or longer with zinc, in comparison with normal controls, and found no differences. In a second study, we evaluated these same parameters in patients with Wilson's disease before and after 1 year of zinc therapy, and again found no significant differences. We have seen no indications of immune suppression or increased susceptibility to infections in our patients, who have now been treated with zinc for up to 15 years.

Moreover she had signs of hepatic failure which was characterized by a considerably reduced synthetic capacity of the liver but low serum aminotransferase levels and a proximal renal tubular disorder. With a negative Coombs test an autoimmune hemolytic anemia was unlikely. Therefore diagnostic procedures were directed at the cause of the liver injury. An increased urinary excretion of copper, strongly elevated levels of liver tissue copper and the detection of a Kayser-Fleischer ring by slit-lamp examination proved the diagnosis of Wilson's disease-presenting clinically only as severe hemolysis.

The patients were evaluated prospectively at baseline and at yearly intervals for up to 5 years by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and photography, quantitative neurologic and speech pathology examinations, 24-h urine copper collection, and a quantitative scoring of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Kayser-Fleischer (KF) ring size decreased significantly during the 5-year study period (p < 0.0001). Although results of neurologic examination, speech pathology examination, and 24-h urine copper level analysis in symptomatic Wilson's disease patients improved during the study period, KF ring regression did not correlate with the improvement in these clinical parameters (p > 0.05). However, there was a correlation between MRI scores and KF ring regression (p = 0.02). Anticopper therapy with TM followed by zinc maintenance therapy is a safe and effective treatment for patients with neurologically symptomatic Wilson's disease.

The abundance of disease-specific mutations and their location at multiple sites across the genome have limited molecular genetic diagnosis to kindred of known patients, and confirm the necessity for de novo screening by well-proven clinical and biochemical means. It is uncertain whether the variety of specific mutations will account for the wide range of presenting clinical signs and symptoms of Wilson disease, and environmental and extragenic factors are likely to be important contributing factors. Chelation therapy with penicillamine and trientine remain effective treatment for most symptomatic hepatic and neurologic Wilson disease. Zinc salts may be used for some asymptomatic patients, and OLT for fulminant hepatitis and patients for whom pharmacotherapy is ineffective. The chelating agent tetrathiomolybdate is under investigation for the treatment of neurologic Wilson disease. Gene therapy is the new horizon for treatment of Wilson disease.

8615370,Present interpretation of the role of copper in Indian childhood cirrhosis.,"A Pandit, S Bhave","A common killer disease of the past, Indian childhood cirrhosis (ICC), which became preventable and treatable in the early 1990s, is now rare. ICC must be clearly distinguished in Indian children from other chronic liver disorders including Wilson disease. Grossly increased hepatic, urinary, and serum copper concentrations are characteristic of ICC. These increased concentrations are easily demonstrated histologically with orcein-rhodanine staining. Environmental ingestion of copper appears to be the most plausible explanation for ICC, as shown by feeding histories, the prevention of ICC is siblings and in the Pune district by a change in feeding vessels, and the dramatic reduction in incidence of ICC throughout India. The nature and role of a second factor in the causation of ICC remains unclear, although an inherited defect in copper metabolism is strongly suspected. ICC, however, does not appear to be a straightforward early onset of Wilson disease because ceruloplasmin is consistently normal and clinical and histologic recovery is maintained in the long term despite withdrawal of D-penicillamine therapy. Descriptions of an ICC-like illness in the West suggest that different mechanisms (environmental, genetic, or both) can lead to the same end-stage liver disease: copper-associated childhood cirrhosis. ICC probably represents a specific form of copper-associated childhood cirrhosis that requires high environmental copper ingestion for its full expression.",1996,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

At autopsy the three livers were subdivided into a large number of samples for a detailed study of the distribution of Fe and Cu, the accumulation of which characterizes the two diseases. In the same samples Ca, Mg, P, S and Zn concentrations were also determined in order to study significant variations or anomalous trends that could help identify these diseases. Our results generally show a good coincidence with literature data within the limits of sample variability. Based on Factor Analysis as well as Regression Analysis there is evidence of a high correlation between Fe and P contents in beta-thalassemia.

All patients had dystonia as their major clinical manifestation but also had dysarthria and at the presentation of the disease had choreoathetoid movements in at least one limb. A multitracer approach with PET was used to visualize various aspects of dopaminergic function; [11C]-(+)-nomifensine (NMF), [11C]raclopride (RAC) and [11C]-L-DOPA (one patient). Correlation analysis of RAC and NMF binding as well as putamen/caudate uptake ratios showed corresponding reductions. The patient investigated with [11C]-L-DOPA had a normal striatal uptake. Generally, structural changes as shown by MRI corresponded to reductions both in NMF and RAC binding. There was no evident correspondence between PET findings and the severity of clinical symptoms seen in the individual patient. In two patients with discrete neurological impairment at the time of investigation, PET showed serious presynaptic dopaminergic lesions in the putamen. Our data suggest that the striatal degeneration seen in Wilson's disease comprises a complex pathology involving both afferent and efferent projections.

Both are effective and nontoxic. TM is a very potent, fast-acting new anticopper drug and its properties may be useful well beyond Wilson's disease. Angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth) is required for tumor growth, and a sufficient level of copper appears to be required for angiogenesis. We hypothesize that there is a ""window"" to which the copper level can be reduced that inhibits angiogenesis in tumors, but does not interfere with vital cellular functions of copper. Using TM therapy, this approach has worked to slow or stabilize tumor growth in several animal tumor models, and preliminary results are also very encouraging in human patients with a variety of advanced and metastatic malignancies. A hypothesis is advanced that copper availability has played a fundamental role in growth regulation throughout evolution and that is the reason that so many angiogenic promoters appear to be dependent upon copper levels.",2001,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Further, several groups, including ours, find rather marginal average Cu intake in the typical American diet. For example, our data indicate that Wilson's disease patients on a typical American diet ingest only about 25% more Cu than is required. This suggests that a vegetarian diet, if it reduced bioavailability by about 25% or more, would be an adequate maintenance therapy for Wilson's disease. Observations in two of our patients, who were on lactovegetarian diets by choice, and who were almost totally noncompliant with anti-Cu therapy, support this view. These observations suggest that vegetarian diets may be a management tool for Wilson's disease.

Unrecognized and therefore untreated Wilson's disease in patients over age 40 is thought to occur either rarely or not at all. Two cases of Wilson's disease presenting at an age greater than 40 years are presented. The first is a 42-year-old Israeli women who presented with fulminant hepatic failure. The serologic and biochemical investigations obtained at the time of her fulminant hepatic failure included copper studies which suggested the diagnosis of Wilson's disease, which was confirmed by an examination of the native liver following successful orthotopic liver transplantation. The second case is that of a 56-year-old white male who presented to the hospital with a three-year history of neurological dysfunction, pancytopenia, and mild splenomegaly. A battery of serologic and biochemical investigations suggested a diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by quantitative hepatic copper estimation and the demonstration of Wilson's disease in three of his siblings, all of whom were diagnosed after the proband case had been identified. This man and his siblings have been treated with d-penicillamine, with remarkable improvement in their neurologic and hepatic function.

No TETA peak was detected in the serum. The amount of TETA in the urine of the two adults was only 1.6 and 1.7% of the dose administered. However, a large unidentified peak appeared in the urine after oral administration. This peak was not observed in a mixture of TETA and control urine or in urine before TETA administration. When the urine after TETA administration was analyzed after hydrolysis with HCl, the unidentified peak disappeared, while the TETA peak increased.

1635439,Wilson disease.,"G J Brewer, V Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan","Wilson disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism. Progress has been made in establishing the location of the gene on the long arm of chromosome 13, and in finding nearby probes that can be used to identify affected sibs of newly diagnosed patients. However, the gene has not been cloned, and the molecular nature of the defect remains unknown. The cause of the disease is a failure to excrete unneeded and excessive copper in the bile for loss in the stool. This may be due to a failure to excrete copper packaged in ceruloplasmin into the bile. Clinically, patients usually present during the second to fourth decades of life with liver, neurologic, or psychiatric disease, but the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. Once a diagnosis of Wilson disease is considered, reliable studies of copper variables can be carried out. After diagnosis, patients must receive anticopper treatment for the rest of their lives, to reduce copper levels and prevent copper reaccumulation. For life-long maintenance therapy, we recommend zinc acetate because of its complete efficacy and lack of toxicity; it acts by blocking copper absorption. For initial therapy of the acutely ill patient, no currently available therapy has proven to be ideal. A chelator-type drug, either penicillamine or trien, can be used for the initial therapy of patients who present with liver disease; transition to zinc acetate can then be made after a few months. For the initial therapy of acutely ill patients who present with neurologic disease, chelation should be avoided because neurologic worsening frequently occurs, probably due to redistribution of copper which temporarily raises the levels of copper in the brain. For initial treatment, zinc therapy is also not ideal because it is relatively slow-acting. A new experimental drug, tetrathiomolybdate, shows promise in the initial treatment of patients with Wilson disease. The major challenges ahead include closing the remaining therapeutic hiatuses, cloning and expressing the gene to understand its function, and improving clinical diagnosis so that therapy can be instituted as quickly as possible.",1992,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

J. Med., 324, 1716-1725 (1991)]. For example, greater potency, safety, improved tolerance in the elderly and reduced frequency of dosing have been achieved. However, these agents are generally considered to be palliative treating of the symptoms of the disease. The development of disease modifying drugs (DMD), also known as second line drugs, for RA has not been very successful. Most of the agents that are currently used in this category were originally used to treat other diseases such as malignancy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), Wilson's disease (d-penicillamine) and tuberculosis (gold salts) [Pullar, Br. J. clin. Pharmac., 30, 501-510 (1990)]. Unfortunately, none of the agents is ideal and each has potentially serious side-effects.

D-penicillamine was shown to increase rat hepatic metallothionein levels; however, the effect was dependent on an interaction with copper. The drug accelerated the excretion of exogenous copper but increased the amount retained on metallothionein. This interaction of penicillamine and copper also provoked changes in the distribution of zinc and in particular an increase in the heat-stable cytosol zinc fraction. In contrast, thiomolybdates were much more effective in eliminating exogenous copper and even removed copper that was already bound to metallothionein; thus, the copper level in the heat-stable cytosol fraction decreased. The observations support the view that patients with Wilson's disease may not be truly ""decoppered"" but that treatment with d-penicillamine is effective because the accumulated copper in the liver is bound in a nontoxic form by the increased metallothionein. The results explain why cessation of treatment is dangerous. The results may also partially explain the effectiveness of D-penicillamine copper chelates as antiinflammatory drugs.",1992,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

This is a report of a patient with cystinuria on long-term, high-dose penicillamine who developed pseudoxanthoma-elasticum-like lesions. Coalescent yellow papules with a 'plucked-chicken skin' appearance were seen in the axillae and on the neck while redundant skin folds were noted in the anterior axillary line and lower buttocks. By light and electron microscopy, involved and uninvolved skin demonstrated 'lumpy-bumpy' dermal elastic fibers with no calcium deposition.

In this study, 64Cu uptake measurements were concomitantly carried out with intestinal biopsies to investigate the relationship of reduced copper absorption to the levels of intestinal metallothionein in patients with Wilson's disease at different stages of zinc therapy. A pronounced increase in intestinal metallothionein levels and a sharp drop in 64Cu absorption were found 4 to 5 days after the initiation of zinc treatment. Conversely, metallothionein levels decreased and 64Cu uptake increased on the discontinuation of zinc therapy. The data indicate that 64Cu absorption varies as a function of intestinal metallothionein level. Intestinal metallothionein levels were found to correlate linearly with urinary zinc levels, which reflect body zinc status. These findings support our hypothesis that intestinal metallothionein induction mediates decreased copper absorption observed during zinc therapy.

Results were compared with the data of an age- and sex-matched control group. 89% of the patients revealed clinical signs of basal ganglia dysfunction, 11% oculomotor or cerebellar symptoms, but none of the individuals had any clinical hint for visual pathway affection. Psychometrically, 100% had mood disturbances without definite intellectual decline. In EP-recordings, 100% showed ERP, 58.0% SSEP and 53% VEP and BSEP abnormalities. VEP and BSEP measurements did not correlate with the clinical score. There was only a weak correlation of SSEP (right-side)- and ERP-amplitude reduction with the clinical total score.

These studies indicate that 75 mg a day is close to the minimally effective dose, but do not address the question of necessary dose frequency. In the current study, the authors have used the minimally effective daily dose, 75 mg, and studied this daily dose in regimens of 25 mg x 3, 37.5 mg x 2, and 75 mg x 1 in treatment of four patients with Wilson's disease.

Interaction with other anticopper agents.,"G J Brewer, V Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V Johnson, R D Dick, Y Wang","Zinc (Zn) is increasingly being used as a treatment for Wilson's disease. Some physicians have been prescribing Zn in conjunction with other anticopper agents, such as penicillamine or trien, although theoretically these drugs might be antagonistic in their effects. In addition, Wilson's disease patients quite often take vitamin C in high doses in conjunction with Zn therapy, and there are indications of possible interactions among vitamin C, Zn and copper (Cu). Interactions of penicillamine, trien, and vitamin C with Zn have not been previously studied in terms of the potential effects of these agents on Zn efficacy in Wilson's disease. Here we have studied these interactions in the maintenance phase of therapy, using Cu balance and absorption of orally administered 64Cu as endpoints. We find evidence for probable interactions of both penicillamine and trien with Zn; however, the end result on Cu balance is about the same with Zn alone as it is with Zn plus one of the other agents. Thus, there appear to be no advantages to concomitant administration. We find no detectable interaction of Zn and vitamin C on Cu balance, when vitamin C is taken in daily doses of 1000 mg.",1993,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

8410043,Geographic variations in Wilson's disease.,"N S Chu, T P Hung","Certain features of Wilson's disease (WD) in Asia have been found to be different from those in other continents. The higher prevalence rate in Japan is presumably due to a higher consanguinity rate. In Chinese there is a tight linkage between WD and two gene loci for esterase D and retinoblastoma in the long arm of chromosome 13. The high proportion of patients with hepatic presentation accounts for early onset of WD in the Japanese and Chinese series. Skeletal involvement, leg hyperpigmentation, dark complexion, amenorrhea, epileptic seizures, and cerebral white matter degeneration are relatively more common among WD patients in Asia. Excessive copper in the liver appears to have a protective effect against hepatocellular carcinoma and type B hepatitis. Electrophysiological studies suggest widespread functional disturbances of the CNS in WD. Side-effects from penicillamine are rather frequent and often lead to interruption of the therapy. Trien is found to be effective without adverse reactions.

Twenty-four patients had a poor response: although the disease process was arrested they were left more or less disabled. Twenty patients died: nine had little or no treatment, but 11 died despite apparently adequate chelation therapy. There was no obvious reason for this failure. The liver copper level was estimated in six of these patients: it was still significantly elevated in only one, but in all four in whom it was possible to make the determination, the concentration of copper in the basal ganglia was in excess of 45 micrograms/g wet weight. It was not apparent why adequate therapy failed to remove copper from the brains of these patients.

Initially, there was some consideration about the indication for LTX in the case of Wilson's disease with severe neurological impairment but normal liver function. From 1988 until 1995, 13 out of 700 LTX (1.9%) were performed for Wilson's disease. Indications for LTX were (I) intractable neurological impairment with normal liver function (n = 4; including one patient with Child A cirrhosis), (II) fulminant hepatic failure (n = 3), and (III) end-stage liver cirrhosis (n = 6) (Child B, n = 1; Child C, n = 5). There were 8 females and 5 males with a mean age of 27 yr (range 15-34 yr). All patients of group I required continuous nursing care before LTX, in spite of pretreatment with d-penicillamine and zinc. The most frequent symptoms in these patients were dysphagia (n = 4), dysarthria (n = 4), tremor (n = 4), sialorrhea (n = 3), ataxia (n = 3), dystonia (n = 3) and handwriting difficulties (n = 3). All patients of group II presented with hemolytic anemia. The survival rate was 100%, and all patients were doing well after a mean follow-up period of 32.8 months (range 8-68 months). The postoperative course was without severe infectious and other complications. All patients of group I revealed the first signs of improvement for all types of neurological symptoms 4-6 wk after LTX. One patient has been without any symptoms from 18 months until 5.5 yr after LTX. Two patients with short-term follow-up also had noticeable improvement of neurological impairment, but residual symptoms are still present. One patient showed only slight improvement.

The amount of all protein excreted was significantly increased compared with controls, 39% of patients presenting with total proteinuria more than two standard deviations from the mean of controls. The changes in protein excretion depended on the duration of treatment. LMW proteinuria was elevated almost exclusively in the first 2 years after the start of treatment, indicating early tubular damage. This is supported by an initially high excretion of beta 2-microglobulin, NAG, and calcium. Increased excretion of HMW proteins, including albumin, persisted over longer periods, which suggests glomerular injury in some patients, possibly related to the use of D-penicillamine. Creatinine clearance remained roughly within normal limits. We propose that renal function should regularly be checked in patients with WD.",1997,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

10830865,Copper transport and its defect in Wilson disease: characterization of the copper-binding domain of Wilson disease ATPase.,B Sarkar,"Copper is an essential trace element which forms an integral component of many enzymes. While trace amounts of copper are needed to sustain life, excess copper is extremely toxic. An attempt is made here to present the current understanding of the normal transport of copper in relation to the absorption, intracellular transport and toxicity. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder of copper transport resulting in the accumulation of copper in organs such as liver and brain which leads to progressive hepatic and neurological damage. The gene responsible for Wilson disease (ATP7B) is predicted to encode a putative copper-transporting P-type ATPase. An important feature of this ATPase is the presence of a large N-terminal domain that contains six repeats of a copper-binding motif which is thought to be responsible for binding this metal prior to its transport across the membrane. We have cloned, expressed and purified the N-terminal domain (approximately 70 kD) of Wilson disease ATPase. Metal-binding properties of the domain showed the protein to bind several metals besides copper; however, copper has a higher affinity for the domain. The copper is bound to the domain in Cu(I) form with a copper: protein ratio of 6.5:1. X-ray absorption studies strongly suggest Cu(I) atoms are ligated to cysteine residues. Circular dichroism spectral analyses suggest both secondary and tertiary structural changes upon copper binding to the domain. Copper-binding studies suggest some degree of cooperativity in binding of copper. These studies as well as detailed structural information of the copper-binding domain will be crucial in determining the specific role played by the copper-transporting ATPase in the homeostatic control of copper in the body and how the transport of copper is interrupted by mutations in the ATPase gene.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) was developed as an effective anticopper therapy for the initial treatment of Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to abnormal copper accumulation. Given the potency and uniqueness of the anticopper action of TM and its lack of toxicity, we hypothesized that TM would be a suitable agent to achieve and maintain mild copper deficiency to impair neovascularization in metastatic solid tumors. Following preclinical work that showed efficacy for this anticopper approach in mouse tumor models, we carried out a Phase I clinical trial in 18 patients with metastatic cancer who were enrolled at three dose levels of oral TM (90, 105, and 120 mg/day) administered in six divided doses with and in-between meals. Serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) was used as a surrogate marker for total body copper. Because anemia is the first clinical sign of copper deficiency, the goal of the study was to reduce Cp to 20% of baseline value without reducing hematocrit below 80% of baseline. Cp is a reliable and sensitive measure of copper status, and TM was nontoxic when Cp was reduced to 15-20% of baseline.

Major depressive disorder was the first clinical manifestation at the age of 38 years. After pharmacotherapy with antidepressive agents, a manic episode was observed. Extrapyramidal hand tremor and micrography were the first neurological signs. Emotional lability occurred during worsening of extrapyramidal signs. Diagnosis was based on urinary and serum copper levels, ceruloplasmin serum level, Kayser-Fleischer ring, and liver biopsy that detected cirrhosis. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed basal ganglia hyperintensity on T1-weighted images, and hypodensity in the central part and hyperintensity in the peripheral part of the lentiform nucleus on T2-weighted images. Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images was also observed in the dorsal part of the midbrain. 123I-iodobenzamide single photon emission computed tomography (IBZM-SPECT) detected a normal distribution of the drug in the brain, with better signal in the right side and deficit of D2-dopaminergic receptors in the basal ganglia.

The most serious sequela is that of progressive central nervous system involvement. The use of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has been controversial for those patients with neurological symptoms attributed to Wilson's disease. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of OLT for patients with Wilson's disease, including those with neurological involvement attributed to copper accumulation in the central nervous system. OLT was performed in 45 patients (19 men [42.2%], 26 women [57.8%]) with Wilson's disease between 1971 and 1993 who were followed up for at least 4 years. The age at diagnosis of Wilson's disease ranged from 3 to 41 years (mean, 17.7 +/- 7.4 years). The age at OLT ranged from 8 to 52 years (mean, 22.3 +/- 9.4 years). Nineteen patients (42.2%) were aged younger than 18 years at OLT. The indications for OLT included chronic hepatic failure in 15 patients (33.3%) and fulminant (FHF) or subfulminant hepatic failure in 30 patients (66. 6%). All but 1 of the 19 pediatric patients (94.7%) were in the latter group. Twenty-five patients (55.5%) were receiving D-penicillamine, 9 patients for more than 1 year; none of the patients treated long term presented as FHF. Thirty-three patients (73.3%) survived more than 5 years after OLT. Fourteen patients (31%) died during the posttransplantation period; 7 of the 14 patients (50%) were aged younger than 18 years. Twelve patients died during the first 3 months after OLT of complications of disease and surgery, 10 of whom underwent transplantation for FHF. The other 2 patients died 6 and 9 years after transplantation of infectious problems. Eleven patients (24.4%) required retransplantation because of a primary nonfunctioning graft (n = 6), chronic rejection (n = 4), and hepatic artery thrombosis (n = 1). Seventeen patients (37.7%) presented with neurological abnormalities; 14 patients with Wilsonian neurological manifestations and 3 patients with components of increased intracranial pressure. Ten of the 13 surviving patients with hepatic insufficiency and neurological abnormalities at OLT showed significant neurological improvement. Our experience shows OLT is a life-saving procedure in patients with end-stage Wilson's disease and is associated with excellent long-term survival. The neurological manifestation of the disease can improve significantly after OLT. Earlier transplantation in patients with an unsatisfactory response to medical treatment may prevent irreversible neurological deterioration and less satisfactory improvement after OLT.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
10529259,"Expression and mutagenesis of ZntA, a zinc-transporting P-type ATPase from Escherichia coli.","J Okkeri, T Haltia","Cation-transporting P-type ATPases comprise a major membrane protein family, the members of which are found in eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaea. A phylogenetically old branch of the P-type ATPase family is involved in the transport of heavy-metal ions such as copper, silver, cadmium, and zinc. In humans, two homologous P-type ATPases transport copper. Mutations in the human proteins cause disorders of copper metabolism known as Wilson and Menkes diseases. E. coli possesses two genes for heavy-metal translocating P-type ATPases. We have constructed an expression system for one of them, ZntA, which encodes a 732 amino acid residue protein capable of transporting Zn(2+). A vanadate-sensitive, Zn(2+)-dependent ATPase activity is present in the membrane fraction of our expression strain. In addition to Zn(2+), the heavy-metal ions Cd(2+), Pb(2+), and Ag(+) activate the ATPase. Incubation of membranes from the expression strain with [gamma-(33)P]ATP in the presence of Zn(2+), Cd(2+), or Pb(2+) brings about phosphorylation of two membrane proteins with molecular masses of approximately 90 and 190 kDa, most likely representing the ZntA monomer and dimer, respectively. Although Cu(2+) can stimulate phosphorylation by [gamma-(33)P]ATP, it does not activate the ATPase. Cu(2+) also prevents the Zn(2+) activation of the ATPase when present in 2-fold excess over Zn(2+). Ag(+) and Cu(+) appear not to promote phosphorylation of the enzyme. To study the effects of Wilson disease mutations, we have constructed two site-directed mutants of ZntA, His475Gln and Glu470Ala, the human counterparts of which cause Wilson disease. Both mutants show a reduced metal ion stimulated ATPase activity (about 30-40% of the wild-type activity) and are phosphorylated much less efficiently by [gamma-(33)P]ATP than the wild type. In comparison to the wild type, the Glu470Ala mutant is phosphorylated more strongly by [(33)P]P(i), whereas the His475Gln mutant is phosphorylated more weakly. These results suggest that the mutation His475Gln affects the reaction with ATP and P(i) and stabilizes the enzyme in a dephosphorylated state. The Glu470Ala mutant seems to favor the E2 state. We conclude that His475 and Glu470 play important roles in the transport cycles of both the Wilson disease ATPase and ZntA.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The genes that mutate to give rise to these disorders encode highly homologous copper transporting ATPases. We use yeast and mammalian two-hybrid systems, along with an in vitro assay to demonstrate a specific, copper-dependent interaction between the six metal-binding domains of the WD and MNK ATPases and the cytoplasmic copper chaperone HAH1. We demonstrate that several metal-binding domains interact independently or in combination with HAH1p, although notably domains five and six of WDp do not. Alteration of either the Met or Thr residue of the HAH1p MTCXXC motif has no observable effect on the copper-dependent interaction, whereas alteration of either of the two Cys residues abolishes the interaction. Mutation of any one of the HAH1p C-terminal Lys residues (Lys(56), Lys(57), or Lys(60)) to Gly does not affect the interaction, although deletion of the 15 C-terminal residues abolishes the interaction. We show that apo-HAH1p can bind in vitro to copper-loaded WDp, suggesting reversibility of copper transfer from HAH1p to WD/MNKp. The in vitro HAH1/WDp interaction is metalospecific; HAH1 preincubated with Cu(2+) or Hg(+) but not with Zn(2+), Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(3+), Fe(3+), or Cr(3+) interacted with WDp. Finally, we model the protein-protein interaction and present a theoretical representation of the HAH1p.Cu.WD/MNKp complex.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

These measurements were treated as indicators of the copper-related toxic effects on the brain and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The half-life of the decrease in the CSF copper concentration during therapy was 23.5 +/- 5.78 months (mean +/- S.E.M.). The therapeutic-target-copper concentration in the CSF (mean normal concentration) is below 20 microg/l. The average length of therapy needed to normalize CSF-copper values in our patients with an average initial value of 76.25 microg/L was 47 month. During the first 10 month of treatment there was an increase in all cases of the measured disturbance in the blood-brain barrier (measured as the ratio of albumin in CSF to albumin in serum, AR). All patients showed an initial worsening of the neurological condition, on average after 1.75 +/- 0.25 months. The maximal rise in AR, from the initial values, was on average 18.4 +/- 5.08%; this maximum was reached after an average of 6.9 +/- 1.5 months. The AR normalized during therapy, indicating a reduction in toxicity in the blood-brain barrier region. The extent of the AR increases in individual patients did not correlate significantly with CSF copper half-life, serum copper half-life, the initial half-life of the reduction in the ratio (copper in serum)/(coeruloplasmin in serum), the initial copper concentration in CSF or serum, the initial free copper concentration in serum, or the initial dose of penicillamine (within the first 2 months). We conclude that the normalization of the CSF copper concentration in patients with the cerebral manifestation of Wilson's disease is a slow process, even if therapy is sufficient. The initial worsening of the neurological condition which has often been reported may be reflected in the disturbance of blood-brain barrier function, which we have measured here for the first time (using the parameter of the albumin ratio CSF/serum). Based on repeated measurements of the AR during the course of treatment it seems that the brain toxicity of mobilized copper can be assessed and the therapy adjusted.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Subsequent diagnosis of WD and introduction of penicillamine gave excellent improvement and complete normalization of liver function tests. The second patient, at first also diagnosed as having AIH, was treated with steroids and azathioprine with initial improvement, but subsequent deterioration. The diagnosis of WD was made 2 years after initial diagnosis of AIH, as the patient reached end-stage liver disease and required a transplant. Therefore, d-penicillamine treatment was not attempted. We conclude that, in patients with AIH, a thorough screening for WD is necessary, particularly when the response to steroid therapy is poor.

10858308,Inhibition of carboxypeptidase A by D-penicillamine: mechanism and implications for drug design.,"C R Chong, D S Auld","Zinc metalloprotease inhibitors are usually designed to inactivate the enzyme by forming a stable ternary complex with the enzyme and active-site zinc. D-Cysteine inhibits carboxypeptidase, ZnCPD, by forming such a complex, with a K(i) of 2.3 microM. In contrast, the antiarthritis drug D-penicillamine, D-PEN, which differs from D-Cys only by the presence of two methyl groups on the beta-carbon, inhibits ZnCPD by promoting the release of the active-site zinc. We have given the name catalytic chelator to such inhibitors. Inhibition is a two-step process characterized by formation of a complex with the enzyme (K(i(initial)) = 1.2 mM) followed by release of the active-site zinc at rates up to 420-fold faster than the spontaneous release. The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis at completion of the second step also depends on D-PEN concentration, reflecting formation of a thermodynamic equilibrium governed by the stability constants of chelator and apocarboxypeptidase for zinc (K(i(final)) = 0.25 mM). The interaction of D-PEN and D-Cys with the active-site metal has been examined by replacing the active-site zinc by a chromophoric cobalt atom. Both inhibitors perturb the d-d transitions of CoCPD in the 500-600 nm region within milliseconds of mixing but only the CoCPD.D-Cys complex displays a strong S --> Co(II) charge-transfer band at 340 nm indicative of a metal-sulfur bond. While the D-Cys complex is stable, the CoCPD.D-PEN complex breaks down to apoenzyme and Co(D-PEN)(2) with a half-life of 0.5 s. D-PEN is the first drug found to inhibit a metalloprotease by increasing the dissociation rate constant of the active-site metal. The ability of D-PEN to catalyze metal removal from carboxypeptidase A and other zinc proteases suggests a possible mechanism of action in arthritis and Wilson's disease and may also underlie complications associated with its clinical use.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
11425282,Is Parkinson's disease the heterozygote form of Wilson's disease: PD = 1/2 WD?,S Johnson,"Wilson's disease (WD) patients often present with Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, most patients with PD have reduced ceruloplasmin, a characteristic of Wilson's disease. WD is an autosomal recessive disease (requires two faulty copies of a gene to produce a homozygote individual) that afflicts 1 in 1000 people. However, the number of people with one faulty copy (heterozygotes) is much larger, probably about 2% of the population. I hypothesize that the large number of heterozygotes for WD are at greatly increased risk for idiopathic PD, because these people accumulate free copper in the basal ganglia at a slower rate than homozygotes, which accounts for the fact that PD usually develops after 40 years of age. In WD, a ceruloplasmin deficiency results in accumulation of free Cu in the liver, brain, kidneys, etc. The excess Cu results in impaired Zn absorption, which would account for the low levels of Zn in the brains of PD patients. Moreover, the high levels of Fe found in the substantia nigra of PD patients may perhaps be explained by free Cu binding to iron binding protein-1 (IBP-1), causing it to malfunction and preventing it from detaching itself from the transferrin receptor (TfR) inhibition gene, resulting in expression of TfR even when the cell has plenty of Fe. The gradual accumulation of Fe and Cu would explain the damage inflicted on the substantia nigra by free radicals catalyzed by these two metals and which is exacerbated by the low levels of CuZnSOD, due to the Zn deficiency mentioned above. Moreover, if this hypothesis is correct, then PD could be used to help discover the gene (or genes) responsible for WD and vice versa. Furthermore, idiopathic PD could be prevented by identifying the heterozygote individuals and providing them with Zn supplementation, Cu chelation therapy and phlebotomy to eliminate Fe.",2001,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Consequently, Cu transport at the cell surface and the delivery of Cu to intracellular compartments are critical events for a wide variety of biological processes. The components that orchestrate intracellular Cu trafficking and their roles in Cu homeostasis have been elucidated by the studies of model microorganisms and by the characterizations of molecular basis of Cu-related genetic diseases, including Menkes disease and Wilson disease. However, little is known about the mechanisms for Cu uptake at the plasma membrane and the consequences of defects in this process in mammals. Here, we show that the mouse Ctr1 gene encodes a component of the Cu transport machinery and that mice heterozygous for Ctr1 exhibit tissue-specific defects in copper accumulation and in the activities of copper-dependent enzymes. Mice completely deficient for Ctr1 exhibit profound growth and developmental defects and die in utero in mid-gestation. These results demonstrate a crucial role for Cu acquisition through the Ctr1 transporter for mammalian Cu homeostasis and embryonic development.",2001,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
11388783,"Micronutrient accumulation and depletion in schizophrenia, epilepsy, autism and Parkinson's disease?",S Johnson,"Zinc has several crucial functions in brain development and maintenance: it binds to p53, preventing it from binding to supercoiled DNA and ensuring that p53 cause the expression of several paramount genes, such as the one that encodes for the type I receptors to pituitary adenine cylase-activator peptide (PACAP), which directs embryonic development of the brain cortex, adrenal glands, etc.; it is required for the production of CuZnSOD and Zn-thionein, which are essential to prevent oxidative damage; it is required for many proteins, some of them with Zn fingers, many of them essential enzymes for growth and homeostasis. For example, the synthesis of serotonin involves Zn enzymes and since serotonin is necessary for melatonin synthesis, a Zn deficiency may result in low levels of both hormones. Unfortunately, Zn levels tend to be low when there is excess Cu and Cd. Moreover, high estrogen levels tend to cause increased absorption of Cu and Cd, and smoking and eating food contaminated with Cd result in high levels of the latter. Furthermore, ethanol ingestion increases the elimination of Zn and Mg (which acts as a cofactor for CuZnSOD). Increased Cu levels may also be found in people with Wilson's disease, which is a rather rare disease. However, the heterozygote form (only one faulty copy of the chromosome) is not so rare. Therefore, the developing fetus of a pregnant women who is low in Zn and high in Cu may experience major difficulties in the early development of the brain, which may later manifest themselves as schizophrenia, autism or epilepsy. Similarly, a person who gradually accumulates Cu, will tend to experience a gradual depletion of Zn, with a corresponding increase in oxidative damage, eventually leading to Parkinson's disease.

Pediatric patients of 1 to 5 years of age were given 25 mg of zinc twice daily; patients of 6 to 15 years of age, if under 125 pounds body weight, were given 25 mg of zinc three times daily; and patients 16 years of age or older were given 50 mg of zinc three times daily. Patients were followed for efficacy (or over-treatment) until their 19th birthday by measuring levels of urine and plasma copper, urine and plasma zinc and through liver function tests and quantitative speech and neurologic scores. Patients were followed for toxicity by measures of blood counts, blood biochemistries, urinalysis, and clinical follow-up. Thirty-four patients, ranging in ages from 3.2 to 17.7 years of age, were included in the study. All doses met efficacy objectives of copper control, zinc levels, neurologic improvement, and maintenance of liver function except for episodes of poor compliance. No instance of over-treatment was encountered. Four patients exhibited mild and transient gastric disturbance from the zinc. Zinc therapy in pediatric patients appears to have a mildly adverse effect on the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio, contrary to results of an earlier large study of primarily adults.

11076401,Wilson's disease.,"G Loudianos, J D Gitlin","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism resulting from the absence or dysfunction of a copper transporting P-type ATPase encoded on chromosome 13. This ATPase is expressed in hepatocytes where it is localized to the trans-Golgi network and transports copper into the secretory pathway for incorporation into ceruloplasmin and excretion into the bile. Under physiologic circumstances, biliary excretion represents the sole mechanism for copper excretion, and thus affected individuals have progressive copper accumulation in the liver. When the capacity for hepatic storage is exceeded, cell death ensues with copper release into the plasma, hemolysis, and tissue deposition. Presentation in childhood may include chronic hepatitis, asymptomatic cirrhosis, or acute liver failure. In young adults, neuropsychiatric symptoms predominate and include dystonia, tremor, personality changes, and cognitive impairments secondary to copper accumulation in the central nervous system. The laboratory diagnosis of Wilson's disease is confirmed by decreased serum ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper content, and elevated hepatic copper concentration. Molecular genetic analysis is complex as more than 100 unique mutations have been identified and most individuals are compound heterozygotes. Copper chelation with penicillamine is an effective therapy in most patients and hepatic transplantation is curative in individuals presenting with irreversible liver failure.

ATP7A and ATP7B work in concert with a series of smaller peptides, the copper chaperones, that exchange Cu at the ATPase sites or incorporate the Cu directly into the structure of Cu-dependent enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase and Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase. These mechanisms come into play in response to a high influx of Cu or during the course of normal Cu metabolism.",2000,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

10474204,Comparative mechanism and toxicity of tetra- and dithiomolybdates in the removal of copper.,"Y Ogra, Y Komada, K T Suzuki","Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) can be used as a specific chelator to remove copper (Cu) accumulating in the form bound to metallothionein (MT) in the livers of Wilson disease patients and Long-Evans rats with a cinnamon-like coat color (LEC rats). However, an adverse effect, hepatotoxicity, was observed occasionally on its clinical application. The mechanism underlying the adverse effect of TTM has been studied in comparison with dithiomolybdate (DTM), and a safer and more effective therapy by TTM was proposed based on the mechanism. The activity of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) in serum was shown to increase significantly on the treatment of Wistar rats with sulfide produced through hydrolytic degradation of TTM and DTM, the latter being more easily degraded. The hydrolytic degradation of TTM was enhanced under acidic conditions. Cu in Cu-containing enzymes such as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver and ceruloplasmin (Cp) in plasma was decreased by excessive thiomolybdates, the Cu being found in the plasma in the form of a Cu/thiomolybdate/albumin complex. The decreased amounts of Cu in SOD and Cp were explained by the sequestration of Cu from their chaperones by thiomolybdates rather than the direct removal of Cu from the enzymes. Although both TTM and DTM remove Cu from MT, DTM is not appropriate as a therapeutic agent for Wilson disease due to its easy hydrolysis and production of sulfide.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
10470603,Wilson's disease.,P Ferenci,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism resulting in pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. The Wilson disease gene is localized on human chromosome 13 and codes for a copper transporting P-type ATPase, -ATP7B. About one hundred mutations occurring throughout the whole gene have been documented so far. The most common is the His1069Gln point mutation. Wilson's disease may present under a variety of clinical conditions, the most common being liver disease (ranging from acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatic failure, chronic hepatitis, and cirrhosis), haemolytic anaemia, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is usually made on the basis of clinical findings (Kayser-Fleischer rings, typical neurologic symptoms) and laboratory abnormalities (low serum caeruloplasmin, increased hepatic copper content). Molecular genetic testing is now the standard for testing asymptomatic siblings. Diagnosis in patients presenting with liver diseases is difficult and requires a combination of various laboratory parameters. Lifelong treatment with chelating agents (d-penicillamine, trientine) or with zinc is usually sufficient to stabilize the patient and to achieve clinical remission in most.

10453198,Treatment and management of Wilson's disease.,"N Shimizu, Y Yamaguchi, T Aoki","Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder related to the copper metabolism. The clinical symptoms are due to copper deposition in various tissues, including liver, brain, kidney, cornea and others. The key strategy of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering both copper-chelating agents and a low copper diet. D-Penicillamine is considered to be the first choice as a copper-chelating agent. Patients require 15-25 mg/kg daily in the early stages of treatment and this drug should also be given more than 2 h before meals. Some undesirable or serious side-effects, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and nephrotic syndrome, do occur in 20-25% of all patients. In such cases, trienthylene tetramine (trientine) appears to be as effective as penicillamine. This drug is usually used when D-penicillamine has to be withdrawn. It is also sometimes administered to patients with neurological symptoms as a first-choice drug. It is given in doses of 40-50 mg/kg daily, in the same manner as for D-penicillamine. Zinc salt administration has also emerged as an interesting supportive therapy for both treatments. A dose of 5-7.5 mg/kg daily is given before meals. The copper content of the diet should be less than 1 mg/day in the early stages of treatment. Thereafter, it can be increased to 1.0-1.5 mg/day during well-controlled periods. Liver transplantation is now performed in many countries for patients with either the fulminant or chronic progressive types of Wilson's disease.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In D2O solution at pD = 7.4, PSH coordinates to Cu+ to form PS(-)-Cu+ under argon atmosphere as revealed from the broadening of each signal. In the presence of dioxygen, the complex was converted to the well-characterized purple cluster species consisting of Cu+, Cu2+, and PS2-. Addition of GSH into this solution quickly decomposed the cluster by the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+. The cluster species was, however, reproduced after several hours because of the oxidation of Cu+ back to Cu2+. The solution containing both PSH and GSH formed three possible disulfides, PSSP, GSSG, and PSSG, under aerobic conditions. Addition of Cu+ to this solution again produced the purple cluster through several redox reactions. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the co-existence of PSH and/or PSSP with Cu+ and/or Cu2+ leads to the formation of the stable cluster species regardless of the presence or absence of the other thiols such as GSH. This must be one of the reasons why PSH works in living cells as an effective drug for the Wilson disease.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

9587157,Wilson disease and canine copper toxicosis.,G J Brewer,"In this article we review the current clinical and research status of Wilson disease and canine copper toxicosis. One of the main clinical challenges in Wilson disease is for clinicians to recognize the possibility of Wilson disease when young patients present with liver disease, psychiatric disease, or a movement-disorder type of neurologic disease. Once the possibility of the disease is recognized, many copper-related tests are available that are quite accurate in making the diagnosis or ruling it out. It is important to remember that this is an inherited disease and that family members at risk should be screened, particularly siblings. The cloning of the Wilson disease gene opened up the possibility that a direct DNA test could be developed, allowing convenient screening of certain patients and family members. However, the large number of mutations already found, with no small set of mutations dominating the picture, have thwarted this approach. Once the diagnosis has been made, a variety of treatments are available. For maintenance therapy, therapy of presymptomatic patients, and therapy of pregnant patients, we use zinc. For initial therapy of patients with liver disease, we use a combination of zinc and trientine. For initial therapy of patients with neurologic disease we use tetrathiomolybdate. Canine copper toxicosis in Bedlington terriers is due to a gene different from the gene for Wilson disease. However, the disease is treatable with the same array of anticopper therapies that work in humans. Recently, we established linkage of the copper toxicosis gene to a microsatellite marker, which has made available a linkage test to breeders of Bedlington terriers.",1998,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

9267106,Penicillamine-induced degenerative dermatoses: report of a case and brief review of such dermatoses.,"K Iozumi, H Nakagawa, K Tamaki","We describe a case of elastosis perforans serpiginosa with additional findings of degenerative skin changes. A 20-year-old man with hepatolenticular degeneration, under prolonged treatment with D-penicillamine, presented with a circular or serpiginous arrangement of nuchal papules. Histopathologically, transepidermal channels were accompanied by granulomatous reactions, with several giant cells engulfing elastic fibers. In addition to these findings of a typical elastosis perforans serpiginosa, we observed scar-like skin changes inside the circular arrangement of the papules. At the scar-like tissue, we found electron-microscopical evidence of randomly aggregated thin collagen fibers with no tendency toward systemic combined bundle formation, which is a characteristic feature of normal collagen fiber formation. Pseudoxanthoma-elasticum-like changes were observed on his neck. On his axillae and groin, slight skin thickening and wrinkling were detected. The diagnosis of elastosis perforans serpiginosa does not represent all of the manifestations or the pathological background described above. The skin manifestations described here represent not only an elastosis but also a total degenerative dermatosis with overhealed collagenosis. Thus, those dermatoses should be summarized as one entity, penicillamine-induced degenerative dermatosis.

Accumulated copper causes liver disease in these patients, and in perhaps two thirds of patients, it causes brain damage leading to clinical neurologic or psychiatric dysfunction. Maintenance treatment involves reversing the positive copper balance. The earliest approaches have used chelators, such as penicillamine or trientine, which increase the urinary excretion of copper. A more recent approach has used zinc, which blocks the absorption of copper and increases copper excretion in the stool. Because of the high level of endogenously secreted copper in alimentary secretions, the reabsorption of which is partially blocked by zinc therapy, zinc acts to remove accumulated copper from the body as well as prevent its reaccumulation. In the present article we present data on the long-term follow-up (up to 10 years) of maintenance zinc treatment of 141 patients with Wilson's disease. The data presented document that zinc is effective as a sole therapy in the long-term maintenance treatment of Wilson's disease and that it has a low toxicity. The results demonstrate the efficacy of zinc therapy in treating the presymptomatic patient from the beginning of therapy. We also present limited data on the use of zinc in the treatment of pregnant patients and children who have Wilson's disease; these data also indicate efficacy and low toxicity.

The vast majority of molybdenum is used in metallurgical applications (stainless steel, cast-iron alloys). Ammonium tetrathiomolybdate is an experimental chelating agent for Wilson's disease. For the general population, the diet is the most important source of molybdenum and concentrations in water and air usually are negligible. The average daily dietary intake is about 0.1-0.5 mg m.o. Molybdenum is an essential element with relatively low toxicity. Enzymes containing molybdenum catalyze basic metabolic reactions in the carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycles. Elimination of molybdenum occurs via the kidney and usually is complete within several weeks. Molybdenosis (teart) is a form of molybdenum toxicity that produces a disease in ruminants similar to copper-deficiency. Little data are available on the human toxicity of molybdenum.

10382557,Copper.,D G Barceloux,"Copper is an essential trace element, which is an important catalyst for heme synthesis and iron absorption. Following zinc and iron, copper is the third most abundant trace element in the body. Copper is a noble metal, like silver and gold. Useful industrial properties include high thermal and electrical conductivity, low corrosion, alloying ability, and malleability. Most of the metallic copper appears in electrical applications. Copper is a constituent of intrauterine contraceptive devices and the release of copper is necessary for their contraceptive effects. The average daily intake of copper in the US is about 1 mg Cu with the primary source being the diet. The bioavailability of copper from the diet is about 65-70% depending on a variety of factors including chemical form, interaction with other metals, and dietary components. The biological half-life of copper from the diet is 13-33 days with bilary excretion being the major route of elimination. Copper sulfate is a gastric irritant that produces erosion of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic copper toxicity is rare and primarily affects the liver. Wilson's disease and Indian childhood cirrhosis are examples of severe chronic liver disease that results from the genetic predisposition to the hepatic accumulation of copper. The serum copper concentration ranges up to approximately 1.5 mg/L in healthy persons. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur at whole blood concentrations near 3 mg Cu/L.

10373684,"Metal ion transporters in mammals: structure, function and pathological implications.","A Rolfs, M A Hediger","Despite the importance of metal ions in several catalytic functions, there has been, until recently, little molecular information available on the mechanisms whereby metal ions are actively taken up by mammalian cells. The classical concept for iron uptake into mammalian cells has been the endocytosis of transferrin-bound Fe3+ by the transferrin receptor. Studies with hypotransferrinaemic mice revealed that in the intestine mucosal transferrin is derived from the plasma and that its presence is not required in the intestinal lumen for dietary iron absorption. This suggests that, at least in the intestine, other non-receptor-mediated uptake systems exist. The molecular identification of metal ion transporters is of great importance, in particular since an increasing number of human diseases are thought to be related to disturbances in metal ion homeostasis, including metal ion overload and deficiency disorders (i.e. anaemia, haemochromatosis, Menkes disease, Wilson's disease), and neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. Alzheimer's, Friedreich's ataxia and Parkinson's diseases). Furthermore, susceptibilities to mycobacterial infections are caused by metal ion transporter defects. The pathological implications of disturbed metal ion homeostasis confirm the vital roles these metal ions play in the catalytic function of many enzymes, in gene regulation (zinc-finger proteins), and in free radical homeostasis. Recent insights have significantly advanced our knowledge of how metal ions are taken up or released by mammalian cells. The purpose of this review is to summarize these advances and to give an overview on the growing number of mammalian metal ion transporters.",1999,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

These abnormalities were mainly described in patients with primary immunological disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. In order to clarify whether d-PA-induced immune disorders are restricted to patients genetically prone to develop autoimmune diseases or to a direct drug effect, we tested for the presence of various autoantibodies and for molecular HLA typing in 17 patients with Wilson's disease treated with this drug. In 2/17 patients, low-titer (10 JDFU) circulating islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) were detected, while another patient was positive for the presence of insulin autoantibodies. None of the sera tested showed reactivity for glutamic acid decarboxylase or ICA512. Five of twelve patients were positive for anti-single-stranded DNA autoantibody. Molecular HLA typing of the autoantibody-positive subjects showed that they carry HLA haplotypes not associated with insulin-dependent diabetes. The insulin response to intravenous glucose tolerance test in two patients with autoantibodies was found to be normal.

Clinical features are highly variable, with any combination of neurological, hepatic or psychiatric illness. The age of onset varies from 3 to 50 years of age. Diagnosis is challenging because no specific combination of clinical or biochemical features is necessarily definitive. The genetic defect is due to a variety of abnormalities in a copper-transporting membrane ATPase. Most of the more than 80 mutations are present at a low frequency, and mutations differ between ethnic groups. At least two mutations are sufficiently common to aid in rapid diagnosis, in European and Asian populations respectively. Molecular analysis can provide a definitive diagnosis for asymptomatic sibs.

We hypothesize that in existing cirrhosis, there may be a fine balance between fibrosis formation and fibrosis dissolution, which may be pushed in the direction of dissolution by anticopper drugs. Thus, in this study, we produced hepatic fibrosis in mice by treatment with carbon tetrachloride, then gave half the fibrotic mice tetrathiomolybdate for 3 months, while the other half of the fibrotic mice received nothing for 3 months and served as controls. Tetrathiomolybdate caused a dramatic and significant reduction in fibrosis as measured by hydroxyproline (the major amino acid constituent of collagen) levels, almost back to baseline levels, compared to controls, who had only a slight and nonsignificant reduction. It is clear from this animal study that dissolution of preexisting fibrosis can be strongly catalyzed by lowering copper levels with tetrathiomolybdate.

On laparoscopic examination, his liver surface was nodular with mixed yellowish nodules and ash gray to copper-colored nodules in the diameter of 3-10 mm. There were large regenerative nodules in segments 3 and 4. Large regenerative nodules and irregular steatosis were contradictory to HBV-related liver cirrhosis, so then we supposed Wilson's disease.

25194954,The promise of copper lowering therapy with tetrathiomolybdate in the cure of cancer and in the treatment of inflammatory disease.,George J Brewer,"Tetrathiomolybdate (TM) is a unique anticopper drug developed for the treatment of the neurologic presentation of Wilson's disease, for which it is excellent. Since it was known copper was required for angiogenesis, TM was tested on mouse cancer models to see if it would inhibit tumor growth based on an antiangiogenic effect. TM was extremely effective in these models, but all the tumors in the models started small in size - micrometastatic in size. Later, TM was tested in numerous human cancer trials, where it showed only modest effects. However, the mouse lesson of efficacy against micro disease was forgotten - all the trials were against bulky, advanced cancer. Now, the mouse evidence is coming back to life. Three groups are curing, or having major efficacy of TM, against advanced human cancers, heretofore virtually incurable, particularly if the cancer has been reduced to no evidence of disease (NED) status by conventional therapy. In that situation, where the remaining disease is micrometastatic, TM therapy appears to be curative. We have designed and initiated a study of TM in canine osteosarcoma at the micrometastatic phase to help put these findings on a firm scientific basis. TM also has major anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting copper dependent cytokines involved in inflammation. This anti-inflammatory effect may be involved in TM's anticancer effect because cancers, as they advance, attract inflammatory cells that provide a plethora of additional proangiogenic agents.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
25178601,Penicillamine challenge test in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease.,"M W Mazumder, M B Karim, M Rukunuzzaman","Wilson's disease (WD) is one of the most common metabolic liver diseases encountered in children. Early diagnosis of the disease is essential because specific treatment can be offered, that will prevent further hepatocellular injury and neurologic complications. There is no single diagnostic test that can exclude or confirm the disease with certainty. Penicillamine challenge has proved itself to be a useful diagnostic test in the detection of WD. The main purpose of this study was to observe the reliability of penicillamine challenge test, in the diagnosis of WD. The cross sectional study was done with a case control design in the department of paediatric gastroenterology & Nutrition, BSMMU, Dhaka. The study was carried out on 60 patients of CLD. Along with other physical findings and laboratory investigations, 24 hours urinary copper excretions were estimated before and after penicillamine challenge. Study results were analyzed statistically. Thirty CLD patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria of WD were considered as cases (Group I) and remaining 30 CLD patients were considered as non-Wilsonian CLD and was labeled as control (Group II). Among the control group, 12 CLD patients were found to be HBsAg positive, 1 had hepatitis-C virus infection, 1 had autoimmune hepatitis and the remaining 16 CLD patients were Cryptogenic. The (mean±SD) age of WD patients was 9.90±28 years; male female ratio was 1.5:1. Most common presentation was ascites (70%). K-F ring was found in 86.7% cases. Serum ceruloplasmin level was found significantly lower in WD patients (mean±SD, 0.1197±23g/L, p<0.001). Baseline urinary copper excretion of WD patients differed significantly from controls (Median 219.0μg/24hour, range 35-2018μg/24hour, versus median 44μg/24hour, range 20-238μg/24hour, p<0.001). Baseline urinary copper excretion above 100μg/24hour was observed in 80% WD patients whereas it was 10% in controls. post penicillamine urinary copper excretion was significantly greater in WD patients than controls (Median 2635μg/24hour, range 648-6222μg/24hour, versus median 423μg/24hour, range 91-1250μg/24hour, p<0.001). Post penicillamine urinary copper above 1600μg/24hour observed in 70% of WD patients whereas not a single patient reached the value in control group.

The WD incidence is approximately 1/50-10,000 live births worldwide. Clinical manifestations of WD may be of any kind, but usually the symptoms of presentation are hepatic or neuropsychiatric, with a vast range of disturbances for both groups of symptoms. In children, however, clinical symptoms may be absent, making the diagnosis of the disease more difficult than in adults. Hepatic manifestations may range from asymptomatic minor biochemical disturbances, to acute, but mostly chronic, hepatitis, cirrhosis or severe fulminant hepatic failure. The spectrum of neurological manifestations is wide, including tremor, hypersalivation, Dysarthria, coordination defects, dystonia, ataxia. The spectrum of psychiatric manifestations is considerable and may include different disturbances such as altered working performance, anxiety, depression and antisocial behaviour. Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF) are present in 95% of patients with neurological symptoms and somewhat over half of those without neurological symptoms. In children presenting with liver disease, KF rings are usually absent. To obtain a more reliable diagnosis of WD, the Leipzig scoring system was proposed by an international consensus of experts.

The predetermined ion-exchange reaction rather than chelation between ZnPB NPs and copper ions leads to high selectivity of such NPs for copper in the presence of the other endogenous metal ions.

The first successful characterisation of binary Cu(I)-CSH and Cu(I)-GSH species over the whole pH range was achieved in this study by the addition of a second thioamino acid, which prevented the precipitation that normally occurs. Appropriate combinations of binary and ternary (mixed ligand) titration data were used to optimise the speciation models and formation constants for the binary species. The results obtained differ significantly from literature data with respect to the detection and quantification of protonated and polynuclear complexes. The present results are thought to be more reliable because of the exceptionally wide pH and concentration ranges employed, the excellent reproducibility of the data, the close agreement between the calculated and observed formation functions, and the low standard deviations and absence of numerical correlation in the constants. The present formation constants were incorporated into a large Cu speciation model which was used to predict, for the first time, metal-ligand equilibria in the biofluids of the human eye.

Here, we found decreased binding of the nuclear receptors FXR, RXR, HNF4α, and LRH-1 to promoter response elements and decreased mRNA expression of nuclear receptor target genes in Atp7b⁻/⁻ mice, as well as in adult and pediatric WD patients. Excessive hepatic copper has been described in progressive familial cholestasis (PFIC), and we found that similar to individuals with WD, patients with PFIC2 or PFIC3 who have clinically elevated hepatic copper levels exhibit impaired nuclear receptor activity.

We report the role of plasma glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the worsening of NWD following treatment. Fifty-one treatment-naïve NWD patients were subjected to detailed clinical evaluation. The severity of NWD was noted, and dystonia was measured by Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) score. Their hematological, serum chemistry, ultrasound abdomen and cranial MRI changes were noted. Plasma GSH, TAC and MDA, serum free copper (Cu) and 24-h urinary Cu were measured at admission and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. The patients were considered worsened if there was one or more grade deterioration in severity scale, >10 % deterioration in BFM score or appearance of new neurologic signs. The median age of the patients was 11 (5-37) years, and 12 were females. Following treatment, 25 patients improved, 12 worsened, and 14 had stationary course. The worsened group at 3 months had lower GSH (1.99 ± 0.17 vs. 2.30 ± 0.30 mg/dl; P = 0.004) and TAC (1.59 ± 0.12 vs. 1.82 ± 0.17 mmol Trolox equivalent/L; P = 0.001) and higher MDA (5.24 ± 0.22 vs. 4.34 ± 0.46 nmol/ml; P < 0.001) levels compared to the improved group.

Zeb2 is expressed in the nervous system throughout its development, indicating its importance in neurogenic and gliogenic processes. Indeed, mutation of Zeb2 has dramatic neurological consequences both in animal models, and in humans with Mowat-Wilson syndrome, which results from heterozygous ZEB2 mutations. The mechanisms by which Zeb2 regulates the induction of the neuroectoderm (CNS primordium) and the neural crest (PNS primordium) are reviewed herein. We then describe how Zeb2 acts to direct the formation, delamination, migration and specification of neural crest cells. Zeb2 regulation of the development of a number of cerebral regions, including the neocortex and hippocampus, are then described. The diverse molecular mechanisms mediating Zeb2-directed development of various neuronal and glial populations are reviewed. The role of Zeb2 in spinal cord and enteric nervous system development is outlined, while its essential function in CNS myelination is also described. Finally, this review discusses how the neurodevelopmental defects of Zeb2 mutant mice delineate the developmental dysfunctions underpinning the multiple neurological defects observed in Mowat-Wilson syndrome patients.",2015,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Affected patients suffer from hepatic disorders and severe neurological defects. Experimental studies in mutant mice in which the copper-transporting ATPase gene (Atp7b) is disrupted revealed a drastic, time-dependent accumulation of hepatic copper that is accompanied by formation of regenerative nodes resembling cirrhosis. Therefore, these mice represent an excellent exploratory model for Wilson's disease. However, the precise time course in hepatic copper accumulation and its impact on other trace metals within the liver is yet poorly understood. We have recently established novel laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry protocols allowing quantitative metal imaging in human and murine liver tissue with high sensitivity, spatial resolution, specificity and quantification ability. By use of these techniques, we here aimed to comparatively analyse hepatic metal content in wild-type and Atp7b deficient mice during ageing. We demonstrate that the age-dependent accumulation of hepatic copper is strictly associated with a simultaneous increase in iron and zinc, while the intrahepatic concentration and distribution of other metals or metalloids is not affected. The same findings were obtained in well-defined human liver samples that were obtained from patients suffering from Wilson's disease. We conclude that in Wilson's disease the imbalances of hepatic copper during ageing are closely correlated with alterations in intrahepatic iron and zinc content.",2015,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
24766067,D-Penicillamine tripodal derivatives as efficient copper(I) chelators.,"Anne-Solène Jullien, Christelle Gateau, Colette Lebrun, Isabelle Kieffer, Denis Testemale, Pascale Delangle","New tripodal metal-chelating agents derived from nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and extended by three unnatural amino acids D-penicillamine (D-Pen) are presented. D-Pen is actually the drug most extensively used to treat copper (Cu) overload in Wilson's disease and as such is a very attractive building block for the design of chelating agents. D-Pen is also a bulkier analogue of cysteine, with the β-methylene hydrogen atoms replaced by larger methyl groups. The hindrance of the gem-dimethyl group close to the thiol functions is demonstrated to influence the speciation and stability of the metal complexes. The ligands L(4) (ester) and L(5) (amide) were obtained from NTA and commercial D-Pen synthons in four and five steps with overall yields of 14 and 24%, respectively. Their ability to bind Cu(I), thanks to their three thiolate functions, has been investigated using both spectroscopic and analytical methods. UV, CD, and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry evidence the formation of two Cu(I) complexes with L(5): the mononuclear complex CuL(5) and one cluster (Cu2L(5))2. In contrast, the bulkier ethyl ester derivative L(4) cannot accommodate the mononuclear complex in solution and thus forms exclusively the cluster (Cu2L(4))2. Cu K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS and EXAFS) confirms that Cu(I) is bound in trigonal-planar sulfur-only environments in all of these complexes with Cu- - -S distances ranging from 2.22 to 2.23 Å. Such C3-symmetric CuS3 cores are coordination modes frequently adopted in Cu(I) proteins such as metallothioneins. These two ligands bind Cu(I) tightly and selectively, which makes them promising chelators for intracellular copper detoxification in vivo.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

This multisystem disease combines clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases, in which liver copper overload is treatable using zinc acetate therapy. MEDNIK syndrome is caused by mutation of the AP1S1 gene, which codes for the σ1A subunit of adaptor protein complex 1, and directs intracellular trafficking of copper pumps ATP7A and ATP7B. Adaptor protein complexes regulate clathrin-coated vesicle assembly, protein cargo sorting, and vesicular trafficking between organelles in eukaryotic cells. A growing number of diseases have been associated with mutations in genes coding for adaptor protein complexes subunits and we propose for them the term adaptinopathies, as a new organic category of disorders of intracellular trafficking, which offers the opportunity to dissect the mechanisms involved in the crosstalk between the Golgi apparatus and the other organelles.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

23689110,Update on zinc deficiency and excess in clinical pediatric practice.,Nancy F Krebs,"The critical importance of adequate zinc status to human health, including normal growth and development, is indisputable. The high prevalence of zinc deficiency on a global basis and its importance to public health have been well documented through large-scale randomized controlled zinc supplementation trials. Similar evidence in the clinical setting, however, is much less widely available due to the nonspecific features of zinc deficiency and to the lack of sensitive biomarkers to detect zinc deficiency, especially that of a mild degree of severity. The current understanding of zinc homeostasis indicates that the primary determinants of zinc absorption are the amount of zinc ingested and dietary phytate, the latter having a major effect on zinc bioavailability. In normal as well as in many pathologic conditions, the gastrointestinal tract is the major site of zinc losses resulting from secretion of endogenous zinc into the lumen and subsequent excretion in the feces. The amount excreted is dependent on host status, the amount reabsorbed, and sometimes the presence of pathophysiologic conditions, including diarrhea and steatorrhea. Assessment in the clinical setting dictates that the clinician obtain a careful medical and diet history, recognize clinical presentations in which zinc adequacy may be compromised, and link this risk with nonspecific but plausible manifestations of deficiency. Examples discussed in this article include primary zinc deficiency due to dietary inadequacy (older breastfed infants or toddlers without zinc-rich complementary foods); genetically based deficiency (acrodermatitis enteropathica, acquired zinc deficiency of lactogenic origin), and acquired secondary deficiency in low birth weight and prematurity, gastrointestinal and hepatic disease, and cystic fibrosis. Evidence for efficacy of zinc therapy with pharmacologic doses for two conditions, Wilson's disease and viral upper respiratory infections, is also discussed.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
23622398,Inborn errors of copper metabolism.,Stephen G Kaler,"Two copper-transporting ATPases are essential for mammalian copper homeostasis: ATP7A, which mediates copper uptake in the gastrointestinal tract and copper delivery to the brain, and ATP7B, which mediates copper excretion by the liver into bile. Mutations in ATP7A may cause three distinct X-linked conditions in infants, children, or adolescents: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome (OHS), and a newly identified allelic variant restricted to motor neurons called X-linked distal hereditary motor neuropathy. These three disorders show variable neurological findings and ages of onset. Menkes disease presents in the first several months of life with failure to thrive, developmental delay, and seizures. OHS features more subtle developmental delays, dysautonomia, and connective tissue abnormalities beginning in early childhood. ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy presents even later, often not until adolescence or early adulthood, and involves a neurological phenotype that resembles Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, type 2. These disorders may be treatable through copper replacement or ATP7A gene therapy. In contrast, mutations in ATP7B cause a single known phenotype, Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive trait that results from copper overload rather than deficiency. Dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, gait abnormalities, and psychiatric problems may be presenting symptoms, at ages from 10 to 40 years. Excellent treatment options exist for Wilson disease, based on copper chelation. In the past 2 years (2012-2013), three new autosomal recessive copper metabolism conditions have been recognized: 1) Huppke-Brendel syndrome caused by mutations in an acetyl CoA transporter needed for acetylation of one or more copper proteins, 2) CCS deficiency caused by mutations in the copper chaperone to SODI, and 3) MEDNIK syndrome, which revealed that mutations in the σ1A subunit of adaptor protein complex 1 (AP-1) have detrimental effects on trafficking of ATP7A and ATP7B.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Wilson on his eponymous disease in Brain, The Lancet and La Revue Neurologique highlight the relevance of his descriptions in the light of the current knowledge. Wilson's invocation of an ""unknown toxin"" appears today as a prophetic intuition as the presence of excess copper in the liver was mentioned for the first time a year later whereas the role of copper in this disease was not described until 1929. Progress has been made to better understand the physiology of Wilson's disease (WD). The ATP7B gene implicated in WD is located on chromosome 13 and more than 500 mutations and 100 polymorphisms have been to date identified. The phenotypic expression is highly variable, even within a family. This can partly be explained by environmental factors as nutrition. Modulator genes are also involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease. Most of symptoms observed in WD have already been described in detail by Wilson in 1912, but subsequent progress was made over the following 100 years, helping the physician diagnose WD. Hepatic and neurological symptoms are the most frequent expressions of the disease. Other extrahepatic features include renal manifestations, osteoarticular disorders, myocardial abnormalities, endocrine disturbances, realizing a multisystemic disease. The diagnosis of the disease is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, biological, radiological and genetic data and new tools (Brain MRI, relative exchangeable copper…) allow reducing delay to diagnosis. Therapeutic findings have also changed the disease prognosis. Treatment is based on the use of copper chelators to promote copper excretion from the body (D-penicillamine and Triethylenetetramine) and zinc salts to reduce copper absorption. Tetratiomolybdate appears to be a promising treatment. While significant progress has been made during this century, many physiological aspects of this disease remain unknown and require further research to find answers in the next 100 years.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Thirty-five patients with WD were enrolled. They were administrated intravenous DMPS in cross combination with oral PCA alternately which was practiced repeatedly, all with Zinc in the meantime. During the treatment, clinical observations and 24-h urine copper excretion as well as adverse effects of medicines were recorded and analyzed. Although the incidence of adverse effects was not significantly different after either intravenous DMPS or oral PCA treatment, levels of 24-h urine copper tended to be higher after short-term intravenous DMPS than that of oral PCA. Adverse effects in the course of intravenous DMPS were mainly neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reaction and bleeding tendency. As compared with oral PCA alone or intravenous DMPS alone, such repeated cross combination treatment could as much as possible avoid continued drug adverse effects or poor curative effect and had less chance to stop treatment in WD patients. Improved or recovered liver function in 71% of the patients, alleviated neurologic symptoms in 50% of the patients, and disappeared hematuria in 70% of the patients could be observed during the follow-up period of 6 months to 5 years after such combined chelation regimen.

The diagnosis is usually made through copper measurement in the liver tissue, followed by confirmation with genetic testing of the ATP7B gene. Currently, there are no effective biomarkers or methods suitable for newborn screening for Wilson's disease. Ceruloplasmin has been tested for pediatric and newborn screening with limited outcome. Recently, liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (LC-MRM-MS) has emerged as a robust technology that may enable multiplex quantification of signature proteotypic peptides with low abundance.

Aberrations in copper homeostasis can create favourable conditions for superoxide-yielding redox cycling and oxidative tissue damage. Drugs used in WD treatment aim to remove accumulated copper and normalise the free copper concentration in the blood. In the current study the effect of decoppering treatment on copper metabolism and systemic antioxidant capacity parameters was analyzed. Treatment naïve WD patients (TNWD) (n = 33), those treated with anti-copper drugs (TWD) (n = 99), and healthy controls (n = 99) were studied. Both TNWD and TWD patients characterised with decreased copper metabolism parameters, as well as decreased total antioxidant potential (AOP), glutathione (GSH) level, activity of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and S-transferase glutathione, compared to controls. TWD patients had significantly lower copper metabolism parameters, higher total AOP and higher levels of GSH than TWD individuals; however, no difference was observed between these two patient groups with respect to the rest of the antioxidant capacity parameters. Patients who had undergone treatment with D-penicillamine or zinc sulphate did not differ with respect to copper metabolism or antioxidant capacity parameters, with the exception of GPx that was lower in D-penicillamine treated individuals. These data suggest that anti-copper treatment affects copper metabolism as well as improves, but does not normalize, natural antioxidant capacity in patients with WD. We propose to undertake studies aimed to evaluate the usefulness of antioxidants as well as selenium as a supplemental therapy in WD.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The majority of published tissue concentrations dates back decades, and was assessed with various methods. Little is known about hemispherical differences, the correlation of trace elements or age-dependent changes in the human brain. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine trace element concentrations in different human brain regions after whole brain formalin fixation. 549 samples of 13 brain regions were investigated in 11 deceased subjects without known history of brain pathology. Regional wet-to-dry mass ratios and concentrations of iron, copper, magnesium, manganese, calcium and zinc were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Cortical gray matter revealed higher water content (wet-to-dry mass ratios 5.84-6.40) than white matter regions (wet-to-dry mass ratios 2.95-3.05). Element concentrations displayed specific regional differences. Good linear correlation of concentrations between elements was found for iron/copper as well as for manganese/magnesium (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.74 and 0.65, respectively). Significant inter-hemispherical differences were found for copper in occipital white matter, for magnesium and calcium in putamen and for iron and copper in temporal white matter. An age dependent increase was seen in cortical gray matter for calcium, for magnesium in all regions except in cortical gray matter, for copper in substantia nigra and for zinc in occipital cortex. The presented trace element concentrations can serve as a fundamental basis for further brain research.

24067922,Potent and long-lasting inhibition of human P2X2 receptors by copper.,"Sukanya Punthambaker, Richard I Hume","P2X receptors are ion channels gated by ATP. In rodents these channels are modulated by zinc and copper. Zinc is co-released with neurotransmitter at some synapses and can modulate neuronal activity, but the role of copper in the brain is unclear. Rat P2X2 receptors show potentiation by 2-100 μM zinc or copper in the presence of a submaximal concentration of ATP but are inhibited by zinc or copper at concentrations above 100 μM. In contrast, human P2X2 (hP2X2) receptors show no potentiation and are strongly inhibited by zinc over the range of 2-100 μM. The effect of copper on hP2X2 is of interest because there are human brain disorders in which copper concentration is altered. We found that hP2X2 receptors are potently inhibited by copper (IC50 = 40 nM). ATP responsiveness recovered extremely slowly after copper washout, with full recovery requiring over 1 h. ATP binding facilitated copper binding but not unbinding from this inhibitory site. A mutant receptor in which the first six extracellular cysteines were deleted, C(1-6)S, showed normal copper inhibition, however reducing agents dramatically accelerated recovery from copper inhibition in wild type hP2X2 and the C(1-6)S mutant, indicating that the final two disulfide bonds are required to maintain the high affinity copper binding site. Three histidine residues required for normal zinc inhibition were also required for normal copper inhibition. Humans with untreated Wilson's disease have excess amounts of copper in the brain. The high copper sensitivity of hP2X2 receptors suggests that they are non-functional in these patients.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Initially, the patient presented with akathisia, sialorrhea, oromandibular dystonia (occasionally grimacing) and slight dysarthria. The patient's symptoms diminished after treatment with d-penicillamine was initiated. No further deterioration was observed after copper-chelating therapy was started. The authors diagnosed acute focal dystonia induced by clomipramine. Botulinum toxin and intensive rehabilitation was initiated; complete regression of hand dystonia was observed.

The deposition of copper ions in many organs has been reported in patients with untreated Wilson's disease. Since these patients sometimes exhibit subfertility and/or early pregnancy loss, copper ions were also considered to accumulate in the uterine endometrium. Wilson's disease patients treated with zinc successfully delivered babies because zinc interfered with the absorption of copper from the gastrointestinal tract. These findings led to the hypothesis that infertile patients with high serum copper concentrations may have implantation failure due to the excess accumulation of copper ions. The relationship between implantation (pregnancy) rates and serum copper concentrations has not yet been examined. The Japanese government recently stated that actual copper intake was higher among Japanese than needed. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum copper concentrations are related to the implantation (pregnancy) rates of human embryos in vivo.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
28303424,Inherited disorders of transition metal metabolism: an update.,Peter T Clayton,"Elements with a biological role include six trace transition metals: manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc and molybdenum. Transition metals participate in group transfer reactions such as glycosylation and phosphorylation and those that can transfer an electron by alternating between two redox states such as iron (3+/2+) and copper (2+/1+) are also very important in biological redox reactions including the reduction of molecular oxygen and the transport of oxygen. However, these trace metals are also potentially toxic, generating reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry. Recently, a role of trace metals in host defence (""nutritional immunity"") has been recognized. The host can deprive the pathogen of a trace metal or poison it with a toxic concentration. Disorders leading to low concentrations of a trace metal can often be treated by supplementing that metal; disorders leading to excessively high concentrations can often be treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine and disodium calcium edetate. This update will address: i) the manganese/zinc transporters (because two new treatable disorders were described in 2016 - SLC39A8 deficiency and SLC39A14 deficiency); ii) copper transporter disorders because we need to improve the treatment of patients with neurological symptoms due to Wilson's disease; and iii) iron homeostasis because recent progress in research into the metabolism of iron and its regulation helps us better understand several inborn errors affecting these pathways.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In children liver is commonly involved. Central nervous system, eyes, RBC, kidneys, brain and bones may also be affected. Aim of the study is to evaluate clinical & laboratory profile of Wilson's disease in children. This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted at the department of Paediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 2011 to December, 2013. One hundred consecutive children of WD between 3 to 18 years of age were evaluated for clinical & biochemical profile. Mean age of studied children was 8.5±1.5 years. Male female ratio was 2:1. Ninety one percent patients were Muslim and nine percent Hindu. Consanguinity of marriage was found in 30% cases. Seven parents were first degree cousin. Family history of chronic liver disease was present in 15% of patients. Most (53%) cases of the hepatic WD presented between 5 to 10 years of age and most of the neurologic WD manifested in 10-15 years age group. Among 100 patients of WD, 69 children presented only with hepatic manifestations, 6 only with neurological manifestations, 14 with both hepatic & neurological manifestation, 10 children was asymptomatic and 1 patient presented with psychiatric features. WD presented as chronic liver disease (CLD) in 42%, CLD with portal hypertension in 34%, acute hepatitis in 20% and fulminant hepatic failure in 4% cases. Stigmata of chronic liver disease were found in 18% patients. Commonest stigmata was thenar and hypothenar wasting (n=8). Keiser- Fleischser ring (K-F ring) was found in 76% of the total patients. K-F ring was present in 84% ( 58 out of 69) of the hepatic only Wilsonian patients and in 90% (18 out of 20) of all neurologic Wilsonian patients. Asymptomatic and psychiatric patient had no K-F ring. About 26% of the WD patients had Coombs negative hemolytic anemia in PBF. Most of the WD patients had altered liver function. Elevated serum transaminase was found in 85% of all cases, prolonged prothrombin time in 59% cases & low serum albumin in 53% cases.

28433106,Novel perspectives on Wilson disease treatment.,"Christian Rupp, Wolfgang Stremmel, Karl-Heinz Weiss","Wilson disease is an autosomal-recessive copper overload disorder causing hepatic and neurologic symptoms. Commonly used medical therapy shows satisfactory results with regard to hepatic disease but only limited effects in neurologically affected patients. In recent years several new therapy options have been developed, showing promising results that might improve the management of Wilson disease in the near future. Optimization of treatment regimens depending on biochemical response pattern seems worthwhile, especially in the decoppering phase of therapy. The chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a promising therapy option, currently under clinical investigation. TTM is a fast-acting and very potent chelator and appears to be associated with early neurologic deterioration after initiation of therapy to a lower extent than the drugs currently used.

28433101,Wilson disease - currently used anticopper therapy.,"Anna Członkowska, Tomasz Litwin","Wilson disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism that can be treated successfully with pharmacologic treatment. Two groups of drugs are currently used: chelators (e.g., d-penicillamine and trientine), which increase urinary copper excretion, and zinc salts, which inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. The mechanisms of action lead to a negative copper balance, stopping pathologic accumulation of copper in the tissues and clearing affected organs of copper overload. Due to a lack of prospective clinical trials, the use of drugs depends mainly on center experience and the accessibility in different countries or regions. This chapter presents the different reports and recommendations regarding WD treatment. In addition to the different expert opinions on pharmacologic agents, there are a few axioms regarding WD treatment: treatment should start immediately after diagnosis, even in clinically presymptomatic cases; the patient should be treated for life, making compliance a key factor in treatment success; and the treatment should be monitored regularly via liver and hematologic tests, neurologic examination, and copper metabolism, modifying the treatment accordingly.

The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). It is confirmed that the magnetic nanoparticles have been functionalized with TETA during the synthetic process, and the concentration of TETA is crucial for the formation of monodisperse mesoporous nanoparticles. The obtained single-crystal magnetic nanoparticles have a high magnetization, which enhances their response to external magnetic field and therefore should greatly facilitate the manipulation of the particles in practical uses. Reaction parameters affecting the formation of mesoporous structure were explored, and a possible formation mechanism involving templated aggregation and recrystallization processes was proposed. The capacity of the synthesized amine-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles toward Cu(II) removal from aqueous solution was investigated. The adsorption rate of Cu(II) on amine-functionalized Fe3O4 nanoparticles followed a pseudo-second order kinetic model.

We investigated the diagnostic potential of X-ray fluorescence (XRF) that allows quantitative analysis of multiple elements. Studies were performed on animal models using Wistar rats (n = 10) and Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats (n = 11), and on human samples including normal livers (n = 10), alcohol cirrhosis (n = 8), haemochromatosis (n = 10), cholestasis (n = 6) and WD (n = 22). XRF experiments were first performed using synchrotron radiation to address the elemental composition at the cellular level. High-resolution mapping of tissue sections allowed measurement of the intensity and the distribution of copper, iron and zinc while preserving the morphology. Investigations were further conducted using a laboratory X-ray source for irradiating whole pieces of tissue. The sensitivity of XRF was highlighted by the discrimination of LEC rats from wild type even under a regimen using copper deficient food. XRF on whole formalin-fixed paraffin embedded needle biopsies allowed profiling of the elements in a few minutes. The intensity of copper related to iron and zinc significantly discriminated WD from other genetic or chronic liver diseases with 97.6% specificity and 100% sensitivity.

A 21-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with marked liver dysfunction and severe hemolytic anemia. Free serum copper level was elevated at 101 μg/dl, and urinary copper excretion was extremely increased (25,600 μg/day). Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration were performed to remove serum copper and to treat the hemolytic anemia. However, liver function did not improve, and she underwent liver transplantation on 28th day after admission.

Mb will selectively bind and reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), and is thought to mediate the acquisition of the copper cofactor for the enzyme methane monooxygenase. These copper chelating properties of Mb make it potentially useful as a chelating agent for treatment of diseases where copper plays a role including Wilson's disease, cancers, and neurodegenerative diseases. Utilizing traveling wave ion mobility-mass spectrometry (TWIMS), the competition for the Mb copper binding site from Ag(I), Pb(II), Co(II), Fe(II), Mn(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) has been determined by a series of metal ion titrations, pH titrations, and metal ion displacement titrations. The TWIMS analyses allowed for the explicit identification and quantification of all the individual Mb species present during the titrations and measured their collision cross-sections and collision-induced dissociation patterns. The results showed Ag(I) and Ni(II) could irreversibly bind to Mb and not be effectively displaced by Cu(I), whereas Ag(I) could also partially displace Cu(I) from the Mb complex. At pH ≈ 6.5, the Mb binding selectivity follows the order Ag(I)≈Cu(I)>Ni(II)≈Zn(II)>Co(II)>>Mn(II)≈Pb(II)>Fe(II), and at pH 7.5 to 10.4 the order is Ag(I)>Cu(I)>Ni(II)>Co(II)>Zn(II)>Mn(II)≈Pb(II)>Fe(II). Breakdown curves of the disulfide reduced Cu(I) and Ag(I) complexes showed a correlation existed between their relative stability and their compact folded structure indicated by their CCS. Fluorescence spectroscopy, which allowed the determination of the binding constant, compared well with the TWIMS analyses, with the exception of the Ni(II) complex.

The only drug known capable of inducing elastosis perfurans serpiginosa is D-penicillamine. We report the case of a 52 year-old woman with keratotic papules arranged in an annular pattern with central clearing and centrifugal growth, located in the anterior cervical region. The patient was chronically treated with D-penicillamine for Wilson disease. Lesion biopsy showed transepidermal elimination of thickened, eosinophilic, branched, sawtooth-like elastic fibers. The clinical and pathological findings were consistent with elastosis perfurans serpiginosa secondary to D-penicillamine. It is estimated that elastosis perfurans serpiginosa occurs in 1% of patients treated with D-penicillamine. By blocking directly or indirectly the desmosine cross-links between elastin molecules, D-penicillamine leads to the synthesis of abnormal dermal and extracutaneous elastic fibers.

Moreover, the list of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders involving a dysregulation of brain Zn(2+)-levels is long and steadily growing, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease as well as schizophrenia, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, depression, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Down's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Wilson's disease and Pick's disease. Furthermore, alterations in Zn(2+)-levels are seen in transient forebrain ischemia, seizures, traumatic brain injury and alcoholism. Thus, the possibility of altering Zn(2+)-levels within the brain is emerging as a new target for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric and neurological diseases. Although the role of Zn(2+) in the brain has been extensively studied over the past decades, methods for controlled regulation and manipulation of Zn(2+) concentrations within the brain are still in their infancy. Since the use of dietary Zn(2+) supplementation and restriction has major limitations, new methods and alternative approaches are currently under investigation, such as the use of intracranial infusion of Zn(2+) chelators or nanoparticle technologies to elevate or decrease intracellular Zn(2+) levels. Therefore, this review briefly summarizes the role of Zn(2+) in psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights key findings and impediments of brain Zn(2+)-level manipulation. Furthermore, some methods and compounds, such as metal ion chelation, redistribution and supplementation that are used to control brain Zn(2+)-levels in order to treat brain disorders are evaluated.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

This pharmacological treatment is categorised into two phases; the first being a de-coppering phase and the second a maintenance one. The best therapeutic approach remains controversial, as only a few non-controlled trials have compared these treatments. During the initial phase, progressive increase of chelators' doses adjusted to exchangeable copper and urinary copper might help to avoid neurological deterioration. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute fulminant liver failure and decompensated cirrhosis; in cases of neurologic deterioration, it must be individually discussed. During the maintenance phase, the most important challenge is to obtain a good adherence to lifelong medical therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases that lead to a mislocalisation of iron can be caused by a culmination of localised overload (pro-oxidant siderosis) and localised deficiency (metabolic distress). A new therapeutic concept with conservative iron chelation rescues iron-overloaded neurons by scavenging labile iron and, by delivering this chelated metal to endogenous apo-transferrin, allows iron redistribution to avoid systemic loss of iron.",2016,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The pathophysiology of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) has not been clearly proven, and drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis has been reported. Wilson's disease is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation in the copper transporting gene ATP7B, and traditional treatment is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine. There have been rare reports that prolonged D-penicillamine therapy might cause adverse renal events such as membranous nephropathy and minimal change disease, but it is questionable if D-penicillamine induces ANCA-associated vasculitis. We describe 2 patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine who presented with ANCA (+) vasculitis and renal involvement. The 2 patients also showed positive results for antinuclear antibody (ANA). Their kidney biopsy findings were compatible with crescentic/necrotizing glomerulonephritis, pauci-immune type. After diagnosis of AAV, D-penicillamine was stopped. Patients were then treated with plasmapheresis and immunosuppressants, including methylprednisolone pulse therapy and intravenous cyclophosphamide. One patient progressed to end-stage renal disease and the other showed persistent proteinuria.

HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Global DNA methylation in liver was previously modified by dietary choline in tx-j mice, a spontaneous mutant model of WD. We therefore hypothesized that the WD phenotype and hepatic gene expression of tx-j offspring could be modified by maternal methyl supplementation during pregnancy. In an initial experiment, female tx-j mice or wild type mice were fed control or choline-supplemented diets 2 weeks prior to mating through embryonic day 17. Transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) on embryonic livers revealed tx-j-specific differences in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the neurological disorders Huntington's disease and Alzheimer disease. Maternal choline supplementation restored the transcript levels of a subset of genes to wild type levels. In a separate experiment, a group of tx-j offspring continued to receive choline-supplemented or control diets, with or without the copper chelator penicillamine (PCA) for 12 weeks until 24 weeks of age. Combined choline supplementation and PCA treatment of 24-week-old tx-j mice was associated with increased liver transcript levels of methionine metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes.

Excess copper-derived oxidants contribute to the progression of Wilson disease, and oxidative stress induces accumulation of abnormal proteins. It is known that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays an important role in proper protein folding, and that accumulation of misfolded proteins disturbs ER homeostasis resulting in ER stress. However, copper-induced ER homeostasis disturbance has not been fully clarified. We treated human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) and immortalized-human hepatocyte cell line (OUMS29) with copper and chemical chaperones, including 4-phenylbutyrate and ursodeoxycholic acid. We examined copper-induced oxidative stress, ER stress and apoptosis by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoblot analyses. Furthermore, we examined the effects of copper on carcinogenesis. Excess copper induced not only oxidative stress but also ER stress. Furthermore, excess copper induced DNA damage and reduced cell proliferation. Chemical chaperones reduced this copper-induced hepatotoxicity. Excess copper induced hepatotoxicity via ER stress. We also confirmed the abnormality of ultra-structure of the ER of hepatocytes in patients with Wilson disease.

Triethylenetetramine (TETA) is a charge-deficient isosteric analogue of the polyamine spermidine (Spd) and a Cu(II)-chelating compound used for the treatment of Wilson's disease, and it has been implicated as a potential anticancer therapeutic drug. In the present study, we studied the effects of TETA in comparison with two other Cu(II)-chelators, D-penicillamine (PA) and tetrathiomolybdate (TTM), on polyamine metabolism in DU145 prostate carcinoma, MCF-7 breast carcinoma and JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. TETA induced antizyme, down-regulated ODC and inhibited [(14)C] Spd uptake. Moreover, it completely prevented α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-induced increase in [(14)C] Spd uptake, and inhibited [(14)C] putrescine (Put) uptake and ODC activity in vivo Seven-day treatment of DU145 cells with TETA caused growth cessation by reducing intracellular polyamine levels and suppressing the formation of hypusinated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). TETA or its N-acetylated metabolites also inhibited spermine (Spm), diamine and semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases and decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Moreover, TETA inhibited the utilization of Put as energy source via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as indicated by decreased production of (14)CO2 from [(14)C] Put.

In addition, high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry have been used to study the purity and chemical stability of the API. A pressure-temperature phase diagram of the pure compound has been constructed and it can be concluded that form II is monotropic in relation to form I, which is the only stable solid. The solubilities of the different solid forms have been determined with the help of a temperature - composition phase diagram. The API is very soluble, at 20° C about 10% of the saturated solution with respect to the dihydrate consists of API and the solubility of the pure form I is twice as high. Moreover, it has been shown that at 20°C, a relative humidity above 40% induces the formation of the dihydrate and at 70% a saturated solution appears. At higher temperatures, the formation of the dihydrate appears at lower relative humidity values.

In the present study, an investigation was conducted to comprehensively analyze the effects of heavy metal (HM) contamination on AMF status, soil properties, aggregate distribution and stability, and their correlations at different soil depths (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 cm). Our results showed that the mycorrhizal colonization (MC), hyphal length density (HLD), GRSP, soil organic matter (SOM) and soil organic carbon (SOC) were significantly inhibited by Pb compared to Zn at 0-20 cm soil depth, indicating that HM had significant inhibitory effects on AMF growth and soil properties, and that Pb exhibited greater toxicity than Zn at shallow layer of soil. Both the proportion of soil large macroaggregates (>2000 μm) and mean weight diameter (MWD) were positively correlated with GRSP, SOM and SOC at 0-20 cm soil depth (P < 0.05), proving the important contributions of GRSP, SOM and SOC for binding soil particles together into large macroaggregates and improving aggregate stability. Furthermore, MC and HLD had significantly positive correlation with GRSP, SOM and SOC, suggesting that AMF played an essential role in GRSP, SOM and SOC accumulation and subsequently influencing aggregate formation and particle-size distribution in HM polluted soils. Our study highlighted that the introduction of indigenous plant associated with AMF might be a successful biotechnological tool to assist the recovery of HM polluted soils, and that proper management practices should be developed to guarantee maximum benefits from plant-AMF symbiosis during ecological restoration.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

A high grade of suspicion is warranted to not miss cases of WD, especially less florid cases with only mild elevation of transaminases, or isolated neuropsychiatric involvement. Screening in first and second relatives of index cases is mandatory, and treatment must commence upon establishment of diagnosis. Treatment strategies include chelators such as D-penicillamine and trientine, while zinc salts act as inductors of methallothioneins, which favor a negative copper balance and a reduction of free plasmatic copper.

Because either excess or insufficient levels of trace elements can be detrimental to life (causing human diseases such as iron-deficiency anemia, hemochromatosis, Menkes syndrome and Wilson's disease), the endogenous levels of trace minerals must be tightly regulated. Many studies have demonstrated the existence of systems that maintain trace element homeostasis, and these systems are highly conserved in multiple species ranging from yeast to mice. As a model for studying trace mineral metabolism, the zebrafish is indispensable to researchers. Several large-scale mutagenesis screens have been performed in zebrafish, and these screens led to the identification of a series of metal transporters and the generation of several mutagenesis lines, providing an in-depth functional analysis at the system level. Moreover, because of their developmental advantages, zebrafish have also been used in mineral metabolism-related chemical screens and toxicology studies. Here, we systematically review the major findings of trace element homeostasis studies using the zebrafish model, with a focus on iron, zinc, copper, selenium, manganese, and iodine. We also provide a homology analysis of trace mineral transporters in fish, mice and humans.

25755520,A review and current perspective on Wilson disease.,"Mallikarjun Patil, Keyur A Sheth, Adarsh C Krishnamurthy, Harshad Devarbhavi","Wilson disease is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism and may be more common where consanguinity is prevalent. Much has been known about the disease after it was first described by Kinnier Wilson as 'progressive lenticular degeneration in 1912. Over 500 mutations of the ATP7B gene has been identified with no clear genotype to phenotype correlation. Loss of ATP7B function leads various grades of reduced biliary excretion of copper and reduced incorporation of copper into ceruloplasmin; accumulation and toxicity of copper in the liver, brain and other tissues results in liver toxicity and other myriad manifestations of the disease. The clinical features may vary from asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, neuropsychiatric manifestations and hemolytic anemia. Diagnosis is based on the combination of clinical sign's, biochemical features, histologic findings and mutation analysis of ATP7B gene. Subtle geographical differences exist with a disproportionate proportion of children presenting with acute liver failure. A high index of suspicion is needed for an early diagnosis. Ratios of biochemical indices for early diagnosis need validation across geographical regions and may not be particularly applicable in children. Better biomarkers or the need for tests for early detection of ALF persists. Drugs used in the treatment of Wilson disease include copper chelating agents such as d-Penicillamine, trientine and zinc salt. Untreated Wilson disease uniformly leads to death from liver disease or severe neurological disability. Early recognition and treatment has excellent prognosis. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute liver failure and end stage liver disease. Family screening in order to detect the disorder in the first-degree relatives is warranted.

They have diverse roles in many functional processes including but not limited to enzyme catalysis, protein stabilization, and energy production. The range of metal concentrations within the body is tightly regulated and when the balance is perturbed, debilitating effects ensue. Homeostasis of brain biometals is mainly controlled by various metal transporters and metal sequestering proteins. The biological roles of biometals are vastly reviewed in the literature with a large focus on the connection to neurological conditions associated with ageing. Biometals are also implicated in a variety of debilitating inherited childhood disorders, some of which arise soon following birth or as the child progresses into early adulthood. This review acts to highlight what we know about biometals in childhood neurological disorders such as Wilson's disease (WD), Menkes disease (MD), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA).

Wilson's disease, an inherited disorder of copper metabolism has varied presentations. We present a case of refractory rickets due to Fanconi's syndrome attributable to Wilson's disease. An adolescent girl presented with pain in the hip and knee joints and a knock-knee deformity since six years. She had received multiple doses of cholecalciferol with little improvement. There was no history of seizures, polyuria, jaundice, intake of drugs, or similar complaints in the family. Examination revealed a severely short stature with widening of the wrist joint and genu valgum. Examination of the central nervous system (CNS) was normal. Skeletal radiographs showed features suggestive of rickets at the hip and knee joints. Routine biochemistry was normal, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was adequate (57.1 ng/dL), with normal corrected calcium (9.24 mg/dL), low phosphate (2.76 mg/dL), elevated bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, and normal renal functions. Twenty-four-hour urine revealed phosphaturia, kaliuresis, and glucosuria with normal blood sugars and aminoaciduria. Blood gas analysis revealed normal anion gap metabolic acidosis with a urine pH of 7. Ammonium chloride (NH4CL) challenge test revealed proximal tubular acidosis. A search for causes revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease was confirmed by low serum ceruloplasmin levels (6.5 mg/dL; normal: 18-35 mg/dL) with high 24-hour urine copper levels (433 mcg; normal: 20-50 mcg).

22389819,Penicillamine neurotoxicity: an hypothesis.,J M Walshe,"Penicillamine, dimethyl cysteine, thiovaline, remains the drug of choice for the treatment of patience with Wilson disease. It is also of value in the treatment of cysteinuria and rheumatoid arthritis, it has also been suggested that it has value in the management of other rare diseases. It also has multiple toxicities. The majority of these can be explained as chemical toxicity, for instance its weak antipyridoxine action and its ability to interfere with lysyloxidea resulting in skin lesions. More important are its ability to induce immune reactions such as SLE, immune complex nephritis, the Ehlers Danlos syndrome and Goodpasture's syndrome. However the sudden increase in neurological signs which may occur in a small number of patients remains unexplained. The theory is proposed that this is due to lethal synthesis. In susceptible patients the-SH radical is liberated from penicillamine and will inhibit-SH dependent enzymes in the Krebs cycle leading to death in neurones. Other toxic metabolites may also be produced such as methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan either of which could produce a similar metabolic block.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Evidence based medicine: After synthesizing the best available clinical evidence I conclude that oral zinc therapy is a conscientious choice for treatment of free copper toxicosis in individual patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hypothesis 1: Age related free copper toxicosis is a causal factor in pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There are 2 neurodegenerative diseases with abnormalities in copper metabolism: (a) the juvenile form with degeneration in the basal ganglia (Wilson's disease) and (b) the age related form with cortical neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's disease). Initially the hypothesis has been that neurodegeneration was caused by accumulation of copper in the brain but later experiences with treatment of Wilson's disease led to the conviction that free plasma copper is the toxic form of copper: it catalyzes amyloid formation thereby generating oxidative stress, free radicals and degeneration of cortical neurons. Hypothesis 2: Oral zinc therapy is an effective and safe treatment of free copper toxicosis in Alzheimer's disease. Proposed dosage: 50 mg elementary zinc/day.

During the past 50 y, tremendous advances in both clinical and basic sciences of zinc metabolism in humans have been observed. The major factor contributing to zinc deficiency is high phytate-containing cereal protein intake in the developing world, and nearly 2 billion subjects may be zinc deficient. Conditioned deficiency of zinc has been observed in patients with malabsorption syndrome, liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle cell disease, and other chronic illnesses. Major clinical problems resulting from zinc deficiency in humans include growth retardation; cell-mediated immune dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. In the Middle East, zinc-deficient dwarfs did not live beyond the age of 25 y, and they died because of intercurrent infections. In 1963, we knew of only 3 enzymes that required zinc for their activities, but now we know of >300 enzymes and >1000 transcription factors that are known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc is a second messenger of immune cells, and intracellular free zinc in these cells participate in signaling events. Zinc has been very successfully used as a therapeutic modality for the management of acute diarrhea in children, Wilson's disease, the common cold and for the prevention of blindness in patients with age-related dry type of macular degeneration and is very effective in decreasing the incidence of infection in the elderly.

The iatrogenous disease depends on DPA capacity to chelate copper and cause its depletion. Lysyl-oxidase is a copper dependent enzyme crucial to the dermal elastic fiber cross-linking, which is strongly affected by DPA copper depletion. Direct binding of the drug to collagen precursors also affects elastic fiber assemblage and maturation. The abnormal elastin accumulates into the middle dermis and produces a characteristic bramble brush or ""lumpy-bumpy"" appearance. In this way it acts as a foreign body and is progressively extruded through the epidermis. Clinically, the disease presents with multiple firm keratotic papules and nodules arranged in annular plaques over the neck, axillae, antecubital fossae, and forearms.

21342755,Risks and benefits of copper in light of new insights of copper homeostasis.,"Daniel López de Romaña, Manuel Olivares, Ricardo Uauy, Magdalena Araya","Copper is an essential micronutrient involved in a variety of biological processes indispensable to sustain life. At the same time, it can be toxic when present in excess, the most noticeable chronic effect being liver damage. Potent, efficient regulatory mechanisms control copper absorption in the digestive tract and copper biliary excretion; absorption ranges between 12 and 60% in humans, depending on Cu intake, presence of other factors in the diet that may promote or inhibit its absorption and on the copper status of the individual. Current evidence suggests that copper deficiency may be more prevalent than previously thought, while copper toxicity is uncommon under customary daily life conditions. Menkes syndrome and Wilson disease are genetic conditions associated with severe copper deficiency and severe copper toxicity, respectively. Effects of milder degrees of copper deficiency and excess copper exposure are not well described, mainly due to lack of sensitive and specific indicators; serum copper concentration and ceruloplasmin are the most frequently used indicators, but they only detect rather intense changes of copper status. Of the many proteins assessed as potential markers of copper status the chaperone of Zn-Cu superoxide dismutase (CCS1) has yielded promising results; data on its performance under different conditions are needed to confirm its use as an indicator of early copper deficiency. Defining copper requirements and upper safe limits of consumption (UL) is a complex process since there are adverse health consequences from both copper deficiency and copper excess (U shape curve). The regulatory framework for risk assessment of essential trace elements introduced by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) has proposed a homeostatic model to determine the Adequate Range of Oral Intake (AROI) of essential trace elements; the nadir of the resulting U shape curve serves to define the AROI. At this range of intake physiological mechanisms allow for normal homeostasis and basically, there are no detectable adverse effects. At present, Recommended Dietary Intakes (DRIs) and Adequate Intakes (AIs) are used to recommend copper intakes at different ages and life situations. Evidence obtained in humans and non-human primates presented here suggest that current copper UL should be re evaluated. Developing the scientific basis for a copper UL and evaluating the relevance of copper deficiency globally are future key challenges for copper researchers.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Long term D-penicillamine therapy causes an alteration in the dermal elastic tissue. D-penicillamine induced EPS has a distinctive histopathologic feature - serrated appearance of elastic fibers due to perpendicular budding from their surface giving a ""lumpy-bumpy"" look.

To efficiently and selectively decrease copper concentration in the liver that is highly damaged, chelators should be targeted at the hepatocytes. In the present work, we synthesized a molecule able to both lower intracellular copper, namely Cu(I), and target hepatocytes, combining within the same structure a chelating unit and a carbohydrate recognition element. A cyclodecapeptide scaffold displaying a controlled conformation with two independent faces was chosen to introduce both units. One face displays a cluster of carbohydrates to ensure an efficient recognition of the asialoglycoprotein receptors, expressed on the surface of hepatocytes. The second face is devoted to metal ion complexation thanks to the thiolate functions of two cysteine side-chains. To obtain a chelator that is active only once inside the cells, the two thiol functions were oxidized in a disulfide bridge to afford the glycopeptide P(3). Two simple cyclodecapeptides modeling the reduced and complexing form of P(3) in cells proved a high affinity for Cu(I) and a high selectivity with respect to Zn(II). As expected, P(3) becomes an efficient Cu(I) chelator in the presence of glutathione that mimics the intracellular reducing environment. Finally, cellular uptake and ability to lower intracellular copper were demonstrated in hepatic cell lines, in particular in WIF-B9, making P(3) a good candidate to fight copper overload in the liver.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The proportions of Metolose and bicarbonate were varied, and the effects of the different ratios on the properties of the resulting powders and tablets were determined. The water uptakes of different powder mixtures were initially evaluated. These tests indicated the interaction of the active and effervescent agent, this phenomenon leading to an unpredicted increase in the amount of liquid taken up. This interaction was evaluated as concerns the degradation of the hydrophilic matrix system. The disintegration of tablets with different compositions revealed that this interaction increases the time required for the disintegration of these systems. The study demonstrated that the interaction of the components induced significant changes in the parameters of this new sensitive delivery system. In the last steps, the buoyancy and dissolution properties of tablets that appeared appropriate for the formulation of a controlled drug delivery system were investigated.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Evidence of thiomolybdates in sulfidic natural waters, and possibly even as metastable traces in oxic natural waters, raises the question of how Cu-Mo affinity might affect Cu availability or toxicity in aquatic ecosystems. Stabilities of inorganic Cu-MoS₄²⁻ complexes are characterized and quantified here for the first time. Two remarkably stable Cu(I) dissolved complexes are identified (T = 23°C ± 2°C): Cu₂(HS)₂MoS₄²⁻ and Cu₂S₂MoS₄⁴⁻. In addition, the solubility constant for a precipitate (NH₄CuMoS₄) was measured. Under the extremely reducing conditions in rumen fluids, these complexes will greatly suppress Cu(+) activity, supporting prior conclusions about the mechanism of molybdenosis. In sulfidic natural waters, they help to prevent complete Cu impoverishment, as might otherwise occur by sulfide mineral precipitation. On the other hand, the complexes discovered here are HS⁻-dependent and could not be important in oxic natural waters (with HS⁻ concentrations < 10⁻⁹ M) even if metastable, biogenic MoS₄²⁻ indeed were present as previously conjectured.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

During the past 50 years, it has become apparent that deficiency of zinc in humans is prevalent. Nutritional deficiency of zinc may affect nearly 2 billion subjects in the developing world. Consumption of cereal proteins high in phytate decreases the availability of zinc for absorption. Conditioned deficiency of zinc is also very common. Growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, rough skin, impaired immunity, neuro-sensory disorder and cognitive impairment are some of the clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency. Zinc is involved in many biochemical functions. Over 300 enzymes require zinc for their activation and nearly 2000 transcription factors require zinc for gene expression. Zinc is essential for cell mediated immunity. Zinc is also an effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.

Even though drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) has some features in common with SLE, they are distinct entities. We report the case of a young girl who at the age of five had a diagnosis of Wilson's disease and she started therapy with penicillamine. Eight years after the beginning of therapy, she developed proteinuria, which was considered to be related to penicillamine. Two years later, she developed arthritis, malar rash and laboratory findings suggestive for lupus erythematosus. At the beginning her symptoms, due to the known association between penicillamine and DILE, were thought to be related to this treatment. In this hypothesis, she was referred to the Rheumatology Centre; zinc acetate was substituted for penicillamine and she started naproxen for the treatment of arthritis. Anyway, the subsequent clinical course and laboratory findings led us to a diagnosis of idiopathic SLE. A renal biopsy detected massive mesangiocapillary proliferation with subendothelial deposits (wire loops) and duplication of glomerular basement membrane (active diffuse global proliferative lupus nephritis, class IV G A).

22327203,Chelation therapy in Wilson's disease: from D-penicillamine to the design of selective bioinspired intracellular Cu(I) chelators.,"Pascale Delangle, Elisabeth Mintz","Wilson's disease is an orphan disease due to copper homeostasis dysfunction. Mutations of the ATP7B gene induces an impaired functioning of a Cu-ATPase, impaired Cu detoxification in the liver and copper overload in the body. Indeed, even though copper is an essential element, which is used as cofactor by many enzymes playing vital roles, it becomes toxic when in excess as it promotes cytotoxic reactions leading to oxidative stress. In this perspective, human copper homeostasis is first described in order to explain the mechanisms promoting copper overload in Wilson's disease. We will see that the liver is the main organ for copper distribution and detoxification in the body. Nowadays this disease is treated life-long by systemic chelation therapy, which is not satisfactory in many cases. Therefore the design of more selective and efficient drugs is of great interest. A strategy to design more specific chelators to treat localized copper accumulation in the liver will then be presented. In particular we will show how bioinorganic chemistry may help in the design of such novel chelators by taking inspiration from the biological copper cell transporters.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Diagnosis is based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic tests. Different treatments based on chelating agents may help reduce the disease's spontaneous morbidity and mortality. We describe three patients who presented Wilson disease before 18 years of age, with initial neurologic symptoms between 1998 and 2010. After comparison with literature reports, their clinical symptoms, progression, and care allowed us to propose a treatment algorithm. Neurologic symptoms are present in 35% of the patients with Wilson disease such as dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, dysarthria, dysphagia, and psychiatric symptoms. The time to diagnosis remains too long and may account for the increased severity of the illness encountered and problems treating these patients. The first treatment choice must be triethylenetetramine, which causes fewer side effects of initial worsening of symptoms compared to D-penicillamine. Zinc therapy is the first treatment for asymptomatic patients or those on maintenance treatment. Finally, liver transplantation is a potential treatment even if the patient presents severe neurological disability because it may improve clinical symptoms.

Excess amounts of copper, however, results in cellular damage. Disruptions to normal copper homeostasis are hallmarks of three genetic disorders: Menkes disease, occipital horn syndrome, and Wilson's disease. Menkes disease and occipital horn syndrome are characterized by copper deficiency. Typical features of Menkes disease result from low copper-dependent enzyme activity. Standard treatment involves parenteral administration of copper-histidine. If treatment is initiated before 2 months of age, neurodegeneration can be prevented, while delayed treatment is utterly ineffective. Thus, neonatal mass screening should be implemented. Meanwhile, connective tissue disorders cannot be improved by copper-histidine treatment. Combination therapy with copper-histidine injections and oral administration of disulfiram is being investigated. Occipital horn syndrome characterized by connective tissue abnormalities is the mildest form of Menkes disease. Treatment has not been conducted for this syndrome. Wilson's disease is characterized by copper toxicity that typically affects the hepatic and nervous systems severely. Various other symptoms are observed as well, yet its early diagnosis is sometimes difficult. Chelating agents and zinc are effective treatments, but are inefficient in most patients with fulminant hepatic failure. In addition, some patients with neurological Wilson's disease worsen or show poor response to chelating agents. Since early treatment is critical, a screening system for Wilson's disease should be implemented in infants. Patients with Wilson's disease may be at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.

A 24-year-old patient developed right upper quadrant pain with a palpable mass and a swelling of the right talocrural articulation. X-rays were uneventful, but the routine examination of hepatic enzymes discovered a 6-8 fold increase in SGPT, SGOT and AST. Antibodies for hepatitis B, C were normal, as well as the ANA, ANCA, antimytochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Ultrasound of the abdomen revealed extremely dilated hepatic, cystic ducts as well as gallbladder. A large, oedematous gallbladder with yellow green bile was removed, the liver was found to be cirrhotic, but as the operative bleeding was abundant a biopsy was not done. Serum ceruloplasmin was low [0.160 g/l (normal 0.204-0.407)], serum copper 12.7 µmol/l (11.0-24.4), transaminasis: always very high, in the last months normal/slightly elevated.

MWS is caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2 gene. The majority of mutations lead to haplo-insufficiency through premature stop codons or large gene deletions. Only three missense mutations have been reported so far; none of which resides in a known functional domain of ZEB2. In this study, we report and analyze the functional consequences of three novel missense mutations, p.Tyr1055Cys, p.Ser1071Pro and p.His1045Arg, identified in the highly conserved C-zinc-finger (C-ZF) domain of ZEB2. Patients' phenotype included the facial gestalt of MWS and moderate ID, but no microcephaly, heart defects or HSCR. In vitro studies showed that all the three mutations prevented binding and repression of the E-cadherin promoter, a characterized ZEB2 target gene. Taking advantage of the zebrafish morphant technology, we performed rescue experiments using wild-type (WT) and mutant human ZEB2 mRNAs. Variable, mutation-dependent, embryo rescue, correlating with the severity of patients' phenotype, was observed. Our data provide evidence that these missense mutations cause a partial loss of function of ZEB2, suggesting that its role is not restricted to repression of E-cadherin. Functional domains other than C-ZF may play a role in early embryonic development. Finally, these findings broaden the clinical spectrum of ZEB2 mutations, indicating that MWS ought to be considered in patients with lesser degrees of ID and a suggestive facial gestalt, even in the absence of congenital malformation.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

These decorporation treatments will also benefit workers in the nuclear industry, should an exposure occur. Cuprimine and Syprine are oral therapeutics based on the active ingredients D-penicillamine and N,N'-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine dihydrochloride, respectively. These therapeutic drugs have been used for several decades to treat Wilson's disease, a genetic defect leading to copper overload, by chelation and accelerated excretion of internally deposited copper. Studies were undertaken to evaluate these FDA-approved drugs for the in vivo decorporation of radioactive cobalt (Co) and polonium (Po) using male Wistar-Han rats. In these studies, Co or Po was administered to animals by IV injection, followed by oral gavage doses of either Cuprimine or Syprine. Control animals received the radionuclide alone. For Co studies, animals received a single dose of Cuprimine or Syprine, while for Po studies animals were repeatedly dosed at 24-h intervals for a total of 5 doses. Results show that Syprine significantly increased urinary elimination and skeletal concentrations of Co compared to controls. While Cuprimine had little effect on total excretion of Co, the skeletal, kidney, liver, muscle, and stomach tissues had significantly lower radioactivity compared to control animals. The low overall excretion of Po made it difficult to reliably measure urinary or fecal radioactivity and draw a definitive conclusion on the effect of Cuprimine or Syprine treatment on excretion. However, Cuprimine treatment was effective at reducing spleen levels of Po compared to controls. Similarly, Syprine treatment produced statistically significant reductions of Po in the spleen and skeletal tissues compared to control animals.

Here we describe how TM inhibits proteins that regulate copper physiology. Crystallographic results reveal that the surprising stability of the drug complex with the metallochaperone Atx1 arises from formation of a sulfur-bridged copper-molybdenum cluster reminiscent of those found in molybdenum and iron sulfur proteins. Spectroscopic studies indicate that this cluster is stable in solution and corresponds to physiological clusters isolated from TM-treated Wilson's disease animal models. Finally, mechanistic studies show that the drug-metallochaperone inhibits metal transfer functions between copper-trafficking proteins. The results are consistent with a model wherein TM can directly and reversibly down-regulate copper delivery to secreted metalloenzymes and suggest that proteins involved in metal regulation might be fruitful drug targets.",2010,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Blood, urine, and hair samples were collected from the patients. All three treatments resulted in a significant decrease of the serum copper levels. Significantly increased levels of zinc in the serum were detected in the patients in groups 2 and 3 (19.1 and 18.8 micromol/l, respectively; p < 0.05). Copper excretion in the urine significantly increased during its administration to groups 1 and 3 (11.5 and 7.94 micromol/24 h respectively; p < 0.001) due to the effect of penicillamine. The administration of zinc as monotherapy (group 2) or in combination with penicillamine (group 3) led to an increase of its excretion (25.3 and 22.4 micromol/24 h, respectively; p < 0.01).

21305118,Zinc and tetrathiomolybdate for the treatment of Wilson's disease and the potential efficacy of anticopper therapy in a wide variety of diseases.,George J Brewer,"Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disease of copper accumulation and copper toxicity primarily in the liver and brain, has been the engine that has driven the development of anticopper drugs. Here we first briefly review Wilson's disease, then review the four anticopper drugs used to treat Wilson's disease. We then discuss the results of therapy with anticopper drugs in Wilson's disease, with special emphasis on the newer and better drugs, zinc and tetrathiomolybdate. We then discuss new areas of anticopper therapy, lowering copper availability with tetrathiomolybdate as a therapy in fibrotic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders. Many of the cytokines which promote these disorders are copper dependent, and lowering copper availability lessens the activity of these cytokines, favorably influencing a variety of disease processes. Copper in the blood can be thought of as in two pools. One pool is covalently bound in ceruloplasmin, a protein containing six coppers, synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood. Ceruloplasmin copper accounts for almost 85 to 90% of the blood copper in normal people. This copper is tightly bound and not readily available for cellular uptake and copper toxicity. The other 10-15% of copper is more loosely bound to albumin and other small molecules in the blood, and is readily and freely available to cells and available to cause copper toxicity, if this pool of copper is increased. We call this latter pool of copper ""free"" copper because of its more ready availability. However, it should be understood that it is not completely free, always being bound to albumin and other molecules. It is this pool of free copper that is greatly expanded in untreated Wilson's patients undergoing copper toxicity.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
20150599,Impact of the discovery of human zinc deficiency on health.,Ananda S Prasad,"The essentiality of zinc was recognized 46 years ago. Zinc deficiency resulting in growth retardation, hypogonadism, immune dysfunction and cognitive impairment affects nearly 2 billion subjects in the developing world. High phytate content of the cereal proteins consumed in the developing world, results in decreased availability of zinc for absorption. Zinc therapy has been very successful and life saving measure in patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica and Wilson's disease. Beneficial therapeutic responses of zinc supplementation have been ovserved in acute diarrhea in children, chronic hepatitis C, shigellosis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, and common cold. Zinc supplementation was effective in decreasing incidences of infection in elderly and patients with sickle cell disease. Zinc supplementation was effective in preventing blindness in 25% of the elderly with dry type of age related macular degeneration. Zinc supplementation in the elderly decreased oxidative stress and decreased generation of inflammatory cytokines. Zinc is an intracellular signaling molecule in monocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages and it plays an important role in cell-mediated immune functions and oxidative stress. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory agent. These unique properties of zinc may have significant therapeutic benefits in several diseases in humans. In many diseases concurrent zinc deficiency may complicate the clinical features, affect adversely immunological status, increase oxidative stress and increase generation of inflammatory cytokines. Oxidative stress and chronic inflammation may play important causative roles in many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, several malignancies, neurological disorders, and auto-immune diseases. It is therefore, important that status of zinc is assessed and zinc deficiency corrected in these chronic diseases. A controlled clinical trial of zinc supplementation in these disorders in order to document the preventive and therapeutic effects of zinc is warranted.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific, including growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males. In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective for the prevention of upper respiratory infection and diarrhea, and as an adjunct treatment for diarrhea in malnourished children. Zinc in combination with antioxidants may be modestly effective in slowing the progression of intermediate and advanced age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson disease. Current data do not support zinc supplementation as effective for upper respiratory infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus.

19934550,Wilson's disease: An Indian perspective.,"A B Taly, L K Prashanth, S Sinha","Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease involving a defect of copper transport by the hepatic lysosomes. It leads to excess copper deposition in the liver, the brain, the kidneys and the skeletal system, affecting most commonly children or young adults and running an invariably fatal course if not adequately treated by de-coppering therapy. The last century has witnessed several changes, notable among these are: Increased awareness, improved diagnostic facilities leading to earlier recognition even in the pre-symptomatic phase, clear distinction from its mimics, aggressive therapeutic approaches owing to availability of effective treatment and an overall reduction in the morbidity and mortality. It is widely acknowledged that the disease is not as rare as once believed. Sir SAK Wilson published his landmark article in 1912, but it was only in 1968 that the first patient of WD was reported from our country. Publications from India on WD have focused on phenotypic characterization, documentations of lesser recognized aspects of the disease e.g. seizures, behavior abnormality, speech and cognitive impairment, sub-clinical affection of visual pathway, heart and autonomic function and pre-symptomatic detection. Attempts have been made to understand the clinical heterogeneity of the disease through identification of biochemical and immunological markers, magnetic resonance imaging, neuropathological study and genetic analysis for novel and/or known mutations. Assessment of impairment and severity and effect of various therapeutic interventions namely zinc sulphate on the long-term outcome and quality of life have also been studied. Nevertheless, clinicians often face difficulties in long-term care of these patients. Diagnostic errors leading to delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment are common, even in patients with positive family history. There is no consensus regarding therapeutic protocols since the use of penicillamine, once a 'gold standard' for treatment, has been debated by experts. Mortality and morbidity of this potentially treatable disease and nonavailability of medications to the poor patients remain a major area of concern.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Control of free copper by tetrathiomolybdate and a comparison with trientine.,"George J Brewer, Fred Askari, Robert B Dick, Julia Sitterly, John K Fink, Martha Carlson, Karen J Kluin, Matthew T Lorincz","It has become clear that serum ""free"" copper (the copper not bound to ceruloplasmin in the blood) is the copper causing copper toxicity in Wilson's disease. But up until now, free copper has not been closely followed during initiation of anticopper therapy in neurologically presenting patients. During this period of initial therapy, the future fate of these patients hangs in the balance-if they worsen neurologically as often happens with penicillamine or trientine therapy, many never recover. We hypothesize that free copper levels are a biological marker of clinical outcome in these patients. In this article, we evaluate the control of free copper in 3 studies of initial anticopper treatment in neurologically presenting Wilson's disease patients. The first (study 1) is a 55-patient open-label trial of tetrathiomolybdate, the second (study 2) is a 48-patient double-blind trial comparing tetrathiomolybdate and trientine, and the third (study 3) is a 40-patient double-blind comparison of 2 disease regimens of tetrathiomolybdate. Free copper levels were determined by subtracting ceruloplasmin and tetrathiomolybdate bound copper from total serum copper. Tetrathiomolybdate showed very strong control of free copper levels over the 8 weeks of treatment in the 55-patient open-label study (study 1), reducing it to a mean value of about one fourth, or less, of baseline. In the tetrathiomolybdate/trientine double blind (study 2), tetrathiomolybdate again showed good control of free copper levels over 8 weeks of treatment, which is significantly better than trientine. In the trientine arm of study 2, mean free copper levels actually went up during trientine therapy. The 5 patients who neurologically worsened on trientine therapy over 8 weeks of treatment showed significant spikes in serum free copper levels associated in time with their neurologic worsening. Patients who did not worsen neurologically generally did not show significant spikes in free copper. Tetrathiomolybdate controlled copper less well in the dose regimen study (study 3) than in the previous 2 studies of tetrathiomolybdate treatment, probably because of a change in the way ""away from food"" tetrathiomolybdate was given.",2009,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

20232210,Copper deficiency myelopathy.,"Stephan R Jaiser, Gavin P Winston","Acquired copper deficiency has been recognised as a rare cause of anaemia and neutropenia for over half a century. Copper deficiency myelopathy (CDM) was only described within the last decade, and represents a treatable cause of non-compressive myelopathy which closely mimics subacute combined degeneration due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Here, 55 case reports from the literature are reviewed regarding their demographics, aetiology, haematological and biochemical parameters, spinal imaging, treatment and outcome. The pathophysiology of disorders of copper metabolism is discussed. CDM most frequently presented in the fifth and sixth decades and was more common in women (F:M = 3.6:1). Risk factors included previous upper gastrointestinal surgery, zinc overload and malabsorption syndromes, all of which impair copper absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract. No aetiology was established in 20% of cases. High zinc levels were detected in some cases not considered to have primary zinc overload, and in this situation the contribution of zinc to the copper deficiency state remained unclear. Cytopenias were found in 78%, particularly anaemia, and a myelodysplastic syndrome may have been falsely diagnosed in the past. Spinal MRI was abnormal in 47% and usually showed high T2 signal in the posterior cervical and thoracic cord. In a clinically compatible case, CDM may be suggested by the presence of one or more risk factors and/or cytopenias. Low serum copper and caeruloplasmin levels confirmed the diagnosis and, in contrast to Wilson's disease, urinary copper levels were typically low. Treatment comprised copper supplementation and modification of any risk factors, and led to haematological normalisation and neurological improvement or stabilisation. Since any neurological recovery was partial and case numbers of CDM will continue to rise with the growing use of bariatric gastrointestinal surgery, clinical vigilance will remain the key to minimising neurological sequelae. Recommendations for treatment and prevention are made.",2010,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In Japan, the standard treatment is the administration of copper chelating agents, such as D-penicillamine and trientine. In this study, the authors used zinc acetate to treat Japanese patients with Wilson disease and investigated its efficacy. The 37 patients that comprise this study were found to have Wilson disease using clinical and biochemical tests and were administrated zinc acetate for 48 weeks. The authors followed the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the patients by assessing their complete blood counts, biochemical findings, as well as the results of urinalysis and special laboratory tests for copper and zinc metabolism. We also examined side effects of the treatment. Zinc acetate did not aggravate the hepatic or neurological symptoms of any of the patients. Blood biochemical analysis also did not reveal elevation of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase levels. Zinc treatment did not aggravate the patients' clinical signs and/or laboratory findings. However, it did improve some clinical symptoms of the Wilson disease patients. Although this agent had some side effects, none of them were severe. The authors measured spot urinary copper excretion, which gave an indication of the efficacy of treatment and of the sufficient dosage of zinc.

Forty children with WD (26 boys and 14 girls, age range = 1.1-20.9 years) and 58 age-matched and sex-matched patients with a liver disease other than WD were evaluated. Both groups were symptom-free and had elevated aminotransferases as predominant signs of liver disease. In all WD patients, the diagnosis was supported by molecular analysis, the liver copper content, or both. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of ceruloplasmin at the cutoff value of 20 mg/dL showed a sensitivity of 95% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 83%-99.4%] and a specificity of 84.5% (95% CI = 72.6%-92.6%).

20660601,Triethylenetetramine pharmacology and its clinical applications.,Jun Lu,"Triethylenetetramine (TETA), a Cu(II)-selective chelator, is commonly used for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Recently, it has been shown that TETA can be used in the treatment of cancer because it possesses telomerase inhibiting and anti-angiogenesis properties. Although TETA has been used in the treatment of Wilson's disease for decades, a comprehensive review on TETA pharmacology does not exist. TETA is poorly absorbed with a bioavailability of 8 to 30%. It is widely distributed in tissues with relatively high concentrations measured in liver, heart, and kidney. It is mainly metabolized via acetylation, and two major acetylated metabolites exist in human serum and urine. It is mainly excreted in urine as the unchanged parent drug and two acetylated metabolites. It has a relatively short half-life (2 to 4 hours) in humans. The most recent discoveries in TETA pharmacology show that the major pharmacokinetic parameters are not associated with the acetylation phenotype of N-acetyltransferase 2, the traditionally regarded drug acetylation enzyme, and the TETA-metabolizing enzyme is actually spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase. This review also covers the current preclinical and clinical application of TETA.

20427090,Effect of glutathione depletion on removal of copper from LEC rat livers by tetrathiomolybdate.,"Yasumitsu Ogra, Takamitsu Miyayama, Yasumi Anan","Tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) is a powerful and selective copper (Cu) chelator that is used as a therapeutic agent for Wilson disease. TTM is the sole agent that can remove Cu bound to metallothionein (MT) in the livers of Long-Evans rats with a cinnamon-like coat color (LEC rats). However, the administration of excess TTM causes the deposition of Cu and molybdenum (Mo) in the liver. In the present study, the effect of hepatic glutathione (GSH) depletion on the removal of Cu from the livers of LEC rats was evaluated to establish an effective therapy by TTM. Pretreatment with l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a depletor of GSH in vivo, reduced the amounts of Cu and Mo excreted into both the bile and the bloodstream, and increased the amounts of Cu and Mo deposited in the livers of LEC rats in the form of an insoluble complex 4h after the TTM injection. The results suggest that GSH depletion creates an oxidative environment in the livers of LEC rats, and the oxidative environment facilitates the insolubilization of Cu and Mo in the livers of LEC rats after the TTM injection. Therefore, the effect of TTM on the removal of Cu from the liver was reduced in the oxidized condition. Wilson disease patients and LEC rats develop liver injury caused by oxidative damage. From a clinical viewpoint, increasing in the GSH concentration is expected to enhance the effect of TTM.",2010,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

For patients with acute Wilson's disease, liver transplantation is the only lifesaving treatment. Plasma exchange or albumin dialysis is often used as a bridge to liver transplantation to maintain a stable clinical status for patients. Hemoperfusion is another effective therapy in removing toxins from the plasma. However, hemoperfusion has not been reported to remove copper due to lack of copper specific adsorbent. In this work, copper chelating agents, triethylenetetramine and tetraethylenepentamine, were covalently immobilized onto macroporous poly(glycidyl methacrylate-co-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) microspheres to prepare copper specific adsorbents. The resulting adsorbents demonstrated good adsorption capacities of 63.44 and 58.48 mg/g, respectively, for Cu2+ ion. Additionally, with the interference of other metal ions such as Fe2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+, the prepared copper adsorbents still demonstrated good specificity toward Cu2+ ion. These results indicate that the adsorbents are promising adsorbents in hemoperfusion therapy for selective removal of copper for patients with severe Wilson's disease.",2010,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Based on the established sensitivity of metastatic melanoma cells to pharmacological modulation of cellular oxidative stress, we tested feasibility of using DP for chemotherapeutic intervention targeting human A375 melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo. DP treatment induced caspase-dependent cell death in cultured human metastatic melanoma cells (A375, G361) without compromising viability of primary epidermal melanocytes, an effect not observed with the thiol-antioxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and dithiothreitol. Focused gene expression array analysis followed by immunoblot detection revealed that DP rapidly activates the cytotoxic unfolded protein response (UPR; involving phospho-PERK, phospho-eIF2α, Grp78, CHOP, and Hsp70) and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis with p53 upregulation and modulation of Bcl-2 family members (involving Noxa, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2). DP (but not NAC) induced oxidative stress with early impairment of glutathione homeostasis and mitochondrial transmembrane potential. SiRNA-based antagonism of PMAIP1 expression blocked DP-induced upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only effector Noxa and prevented downregulation of the Noxa-antagonist Mcl-1, rescuing melanoma cells from DP-induced apoptosis. Intraperitoneal administration of DP displayed significant antimelanoma activity in a murine A375 xenograft model. It remains to be seen if melanoma cell-directed induction of UPR and apoptosis using DP or improved DP-derivatives can be harnessed for future chemotherapeutic intervention.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

8521757,Practical recommendations and new therapies for Wilson's disease.,G J Brewer,"Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper accumulation. The basic defect is a failure of excretion of excess copper in the bile by the liver for loss in the stool. The accumulating copper causes damage primarily to the liver and the brain. Patients typically present in the second to the fourth decades of life with liver disease, a neurological disease of the movement disorder type, or a wide array of behavioural disturbances. Because the manifestations of Wilson's disease are so protean, and the disease masquerades so well as something else, recognition of the possibility of Wilson's disease is a major problem, leading to serious underdiagnosis of the disease. Excellent therapies exist for both the prophylaxis and treatment of Wilson's disease. The longer recognition and diagnosis are delayed, the greater the risk of permanent damage to liver and/or brain. The availability of effective therapy and the risks in delay or therapy make the earliest possible diagnosis critical. Once the disease comes under consideration, a series of diagnostic steps can be undertaken which almost always establish or rule out the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. These include urine copper, blood ceruloplasmin, slit lamp examination for Kayser-Fleischer rings, and liver biopsy with quantitative copper assay. Currently, there are 4 drugs being used as anticopper agents in Wilson's disease. These are zinc, which blocks intestinal absorption of copper, penicillamine and trientine, both of which are chelators that increase urinary excretion of copper, and tetrathiomolybdate which forms a tripartite complex with copper and protein, and can block copper absorption from the intestine, or render blood copper non-toxic. Zinc is clearly the treatment of choice, in our opinion, for maintenance therapy, for the treatment of the presymptomatic patient from the beginning and for the treatment of the pregnant patient, because of its complete efficacy and lack of toxicity. For the initial treatment of the patient presenting with mild liver failure, we empirically use a combination of trientine and zinc. Trientine gives a strong, fast, negative copper balance, and zinc induces hepatic metallothionein, which sequesters hepatic copper. For the initial treatment of patients presenting with neurological disease we use an experimental drug, tetrathiomolybdate, which provides rapid, safe control of copper. These latter patients are at great risk of serious permanent neurological worsening with penicillamine, and zinc is too slow-acting, in our judgment, to be optimal.",1995,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
2196164,Current therapy of chronic liver disease.,"M W Stavinoha, R D Soloway","The study of chronic liver disease has been hampered by insufficient information relative to the pathogenesis of the many forms of hepatitis. Consequently, well-designed treatment strategies are frequently lacking. Wilson's disease is characterised by excessive copper accumulation in the liver and other organs. While d-penicillamine is clearly effective, many patients may not tolerate its many adverse effects. Trientine, oral zinc and unithiol have all shown promise as therapeutic alternatives. Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis responds well to prednisone and azathioprine. Cyclosporin has also produced clinical improvement in several case reports but no comparison has yet been made with the current standard therapy. Recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN alpha) has demonstrated the ability to inhibit hepatitis B viral replication, and the combination of oral corticosteroids followed by IFN alpha is more effective than either agent alone in eliminating viral replication in patients with chronic active hepatitis B. Currently, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) has no standard medical management, but corticosteroids and methotrexate may each have a future role in its treatment. Drug treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) has been disappointing, and early reports of success with d-penicillamine were not confirmed in large well-controlled trials. While some reports of improvement with several agents have been described, larger studies are still needed. Alcoholic liver disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality and numerous investigators have researched several different medical avenues of treatment. Success reported with androgens and the antithyroid agent propylthiouracil in alcoholic liver disease will need confirmation by other research before these agents can be recommended for routine use. Finally, colchicine may prove to be effective in slowing the rate of fibrosis in cirrhosis, but this has yet to be conclusively proven.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

There is a further focus on copper transport in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Copper homeostasis is essential for the well-being of all organisms, from bacteria to yeast to humans: survival depends on maintaining the required supply of copper for the many enzymes, dependent on copper for activity, while ensuring that there is no excess free copper, which would cause toxicity. A virtual orchestra of proteins are required to achieve copper homeostasis. For copper uptake, Cu(II) is first reduced to Cu(I) via a membrane-bound reductase. The reduced copper can then be internalised by a copper transporter where it is transferred to copper chaperones for transport and specific delivery to various organelles. Of significance are internal copper transporters, ATP7A and ATP7B, notable for their role in disorders of copper deficiency and toxicity, Menkes and Wilson's disease, respectively. Metallothioneins and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase can protect against excess copper in cells. It is clear too, increasing age, environmental and lifestyle factors impact on brain copper. Studies on AD suggest an important role for copper in the brain, with some AD therapies focusing on mobilising copper in AD brains.

23401182,The effect of zinc and the role of p53 in copper-induced cellular stress responses.,"Alessia Formigari, Elisa Gregianin, Paola Irato","Metals can directly or indirectly cause an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in cells, and this may result in programmed cell death. A number of previous studies have shown that zinc (Zn) modulates mitogenic activity via several signalling pathways, such as AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF -κB), AP-1 and p53. The exact role that Zn plays in the regulation of apoptosis remains ambiguous. Intracellular free Zn modulates p53 activity and stability, and excess Zn alters the p53 protein structure and down-regulates p53's binding to DNA. Copper (Cu) accumulation causes apoptosis that seems to be mediated by DNA damage and subsequent p53 activation. Cu can also displace Zn from its normal binding site on p53, resulting in abnormal protein folding and disruption of p53 function. In spite of the induction of the tumour suppressor p53, hepatic Cu accumulation significantly increases the risk of cancerous neoplasm both in humans and rats, suggesting that p53 function may be impaired in these cells. It is generally understood that imbalances in Cu and Zn levels may lead to a higher prevalence of p53 mutations. An increased number of p53 mutations have been found in liver samples from Wilson's disease (WD) patients. High levels of the p53 mutation most probably contribute to the pathogenesis of cancer in individuals with WD, but the cause and effect are not clear. The protein p53 also plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of metallothionein, which indicates a novel regulatory role for p53. This review discusses the central role of p53 and the redox-inert metal Zn in the cellular stress responses induced by the redox active biometal Cu.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

23202417,Complex formation equilibria of Cu(II) and Zn(II) with triethylenetetramine and its mono- and di-acetyl metabolites.,"Valeria M Nurchi, Guido Crisponi, Miriam Crespo-Alonso, Joanna I Lachowicz, Zbigniew Szewczuk, Garth J S Cooper","Triethylenetetramine (TETA) dihydrochloride, or trientine, is a therapeutic molecule that has long been used as a copper-chelating agent for the second-line treatment of patients with Wilson's disease. More recently, it has also been employed as an experimental therapeutic molecule in diabetes where it improves cardiac structure in patients with diabetic cardiomyopathy and left-ventricular hypertrophy. TETA is metabolized by acetylation, which leads to the formation of two main metabolites in humans and other mammals, monoacetyl-TETA (MAT) and diacetyl-TETA (DAT). These metabolites have been identified in the plasma and urine of healthy and diabetic subjects treated with TETA, and could themselves play a role in TETA-mediated copper chelation and restoration of physiological copper regulation in diabetes. In this regard, a potentiometric and spectrophotometric study of Cu(II)-complex formation equilibria of TETA, MAT and DAT is presented here, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the stoichiometries of the complexes formed and of their relative stability constants. A potentiometric study has also been conducted on the corresponding Zn(II) complexes, to evaluate any possible interference with TETA-mediated Cu(II) binding by this second physiological transition-metal ion, which is present in similar concentrations in human plasma and which also binds to TETA. An ESI-MS study of these systems has both confirmed the complex formation mechanisms established from the potentiometric and spectrophotometric results, and in addition provided direct information on the stoichiometry of the complexes formed in solution. These data when taken together show that the 1 : 1 complexes formed with Cu(II) and Zn(II) have different degrees of protonation. The stability of the Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes with the three ligands, evaluated by the parameters pCu and pZn, decreases with the introduction of the acetyl groups. Nevertheless the stability of Cu(II) complexes with MAT is sufficiently high to enable its participation in copper scavenging from the patient. A speciation study of the behavior of TETA and MAT with Cu(II) in the presence of Zn(II) at peri-physiological plasma concentrations is also presented. While Zn(II) did not hinder copper binding, the possibility is raised that prolonged TETA treatment could possibly alter the homeostatic regulation of this essential metal ion. The lack of reliable literature stability constants concerning the Cu(II) and Zn(II) interaction with the major transport proteins in plasma is also briefly considered.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Adverse effects during normal use of the drug are frequent and may include skin lesions. To evaluate its toxic effects in clinical cases an original method based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to amperometric detection in a specific biological matrix such as skin has been developed. The chromatographic analysis of D-penicillamine was carried out on a C18 column using a mixture of acid phosphate buffer and methanol as the mobile phase. Satisfactory sensitivity was obtained by oxidizing the molecule at +0.95 V with respect to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A chemical reduction of D-penicillamine-protein disulphide bonds using dithioerythritol combined with microwaves was necessary for the determination of the total amount of D-penicillamine in skin specimens. A further solid-phase extraction procedure on C18 cartridges was implemented for the sample clean-up. The whole analytical procedure was validated: high extraction yield (>91.0%) and satisfactory precision (RSD<6.8%) values were obtained. It was successfully applied to skin samples from a patient who was previously under a long-term, high-dose treatment with the drug and presented serious D-penicillamine-related dermatoses.

16382340,Wilson disease.,"Reinhard Kitzberger, Christian Madl, Peter Ferenci","Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of copper metabolism, resulting in pathological accumulation of copper in many organs and tissues. The hallmarks of the disease are the presence of liver disease, neurologic symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings. The leading neurologic symptoms in WD are dysathria, dyspraxia, ataxia, and Parkinsonian-like extrapyramidal signs. Changes in the basal ganglia in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are characteristic features of the disease. In presence of liver cirrhosis, some features may resemble hepatic encephalopathy. Symptoms and MRI abnormalities may be fully reversible on treatment with zinc or copper chelators. Improvement can be monitored by serial recording of brain-stem-evoked responses. The basic defect is an impaired trafficking of copper in hepatocytes. ATP7B is the gene product of the WD gene located on chromosome 13 and resides in hepatocytes in the trans-Golgi network, transporting copper into the secretory pathway for incorporation into apoceruloplasmin and excretion into the bile. While about 40% of patients preset with neurologic symptoms, little is known about the role of copper and ATP7B in the central nervous system. In some brain areas, like in the pineal gland, ATP7B is expressed and functionally active. Increasing evidence supports an important role for metals in neurobiology. Two proteins related to neurodegeneration are copper-binding proteins (1) the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein related to Alzheimer's disease, and (2) the Prion protein, related to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A major source of free-radical production in the brain derives from copper. To prevent metal-mediated oxidative stress, cells have evolved complex metal transport systems. APP is a major regulator of neuronal copper homeostasis and has a copper-binding domain (CuBD). The surface location of this site, structural homology of CuBD to copper chaperones, and the role of APP in neuronal copper homeostasis are consistent with the CuBD acting as a neuronal metallotransporter. There are several copper-containing enzymes in the brain, like dopamine beta hydroxylase or Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Their function may be altered because of copper overload. WD appears to be associated with a dopaminergic deficit. Mutations in the SOD1gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Survival of transgenic mice with a mutant SOD1 which fails to incorporate Cu((2+)) in its active site was improved by copper depletion. Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder in which copper pathologically accumulates primarily within the liver and subsequently in the neurologic system and many other organs and tissues. Presence of liver disease, neurologic symptoms, and Kayser-Fleischer corneal rings are the hallmarks of the disease.",2005,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The pathogenesis of hepatic and neurologic Wilson disease is a direct consequence of copper accumulation. Presence of copper causes oxidative stress resulting in cell destruction. The diagnosis of Wilson disease requires a combination of a variety of clinical symptoms, biochemical tests, and detection of gene mutations, which are the basis of a score proposed by a group of international experts. Initial treatment for symptomatic patients should include a chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine).

11855743,Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) prevents copper-mediated in vitro free radical formation.,"M Hermes-Lima, M S Gonçalves, R G Andrade","Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) is an iron chelator with antioxidant activity, low toxicity and is useful in the experimental treatment of iron-overload diseases. Previous studies on x-ray diffraction have revealed that PIH also forms a complex with Cu(II). Since the main drug of choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease, d-penicillamine, causes a series of side effects, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative copper chelating agents for clinical use. These chelators must also have antioxidant activity because oxidative stress is associated with brain and liver copper-overload. In this work we tested the ability of PIH to prevent in vitro free radical formation mediated by Cu(II), ascorbate and dissolved O2. Degradation of 2-deoxyribose mediated by 10 microM Cu(II) and 3 mM ascorbate was fully inhibited by 10 microM PIH (I50 = 6 microM) or 20 microM d-penicillamine (I50 = 10 microM). The antioxidant efficiency of PIH remained unchanged with increasing concentrations (from 1 to 15 mM) of the hydroxyl radical detector molecule, 2-deoxyribose, indicating that PIH does not act as a hydroxyl scavenger. On the other hand, the efficiency of PIH (against copper-mediated 2-deoxyribose degradation and ascorbate oxidation) was inversely proportional to the Cu(II) concentration, suggesting a competition between PIH and ascorbate for complexation with Cu(lI). An almost full inhibitory effect by PIH was observed when the ratio PIH:copper was 1:1. A similar result was obtained with the measurement of copper plus ascorbate-mediated O2 uptake. Moreover, spectral studies of the copper and PIH interaction showed a peak at 455 nm and also indicated the formation of a stable Cu(II) complex with PIH with a 1:1 ratio. These data demonstrated that PIH prevents hydroxyl radical formation and oxidative damage to 2-deoxyribose by forming a complex with Cu(II) that is not reactive with ascorbate (first step of the reactions leading to hydroxyl radical formation from Cu(II), ascorbate and O2) and does not participate in Haber-Weiss reactions.",2001,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The gene for this disorder has been cloned and identified to encode a copper-transporting ATPase (ATP7B), a member of a large family of cation transporters, the P-type ATPases. In addition to the core elements common to all P-type ATPases, the Wilson copper-transporting ATPase has a large cytoplasmic N-terminus comprised six heavy metal associated (HMA) domains, each of which contains the copper-binding sequence motif GMT/HCXXC. Extensive studies addressing the functional, regulatory, and structural aspects of heavy metal transport by heavy metal transporters in general, have offered great insights into copper transport by Wilson copper-transporting ATPase. The findings from these studies have been used together with homology modeling of the Wilson disease copper-transporting ATPases based on the X-ray structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium-ATPase, to present a hypothetical model of the mechanism of copper transport by copper-transporting ATPases.",2002,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Serum copper, ceruloplasmin and 24-h urine measurements were evaluated in patients with celiac (n = 32), Crohn's (n = 25), Wilson's (n = 11) and in a healthy group (n = 35). Serum and 24-h urine zinc levels, AST, ALT, BUN, creatinine, iron, hemoglobin, hematocrit, lymphocyte, sedimentation and CRP levels were also measured. Results were evaluated statistically and significance was accepted as meaningful if P < 0.05. In celiacs, levels of urine copper were high (52 +/- 29 microg/day, P < 0.000) but serum copper was the same as in controls (105 +/- 16 microg/dl, P < 0.158). High urinary copper of celiacs were coming out in women (56 +/- 30 microg/day) and in man (33 +/- 17 microg/day, P < 0.115). Most celiacs were female (P < 0.001). Serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels in all groups were higher in women than in men and this was meaningful for serum copper in the control group (P < 0.045) and for ceruloplasmin in Crohn's (P < 0.055) and control groups (P < 0.031). Serum (70 +/- 14 microg/dl, P < 0.000) and urine zinc levels (25 +/- 15 microg/dl, P < 0.039) of celiacs were low. Ceruloplasmin levels were higher in celiacs (337 +/- 64 U/1) and Crohn's patients (366 +/- 47 U/l, P < 0.000). Correlations observed in the groups of celiac (P < 0.029) and Crohn's (P < 0.024), celiac and Wilson's (P < 0.001) and Crohn's and Wilson's (P < 0.001) between the ceruloplasmin and 24-h urine copper parameters. AST and ALT levels were higher in celiac and Wilson's patients than in Crohn's patients and controls. Mean CRP levels were significantly higher in Crohn's than others. Lymphocyte counts were meaningfully higher in celiacs. Statistically, while mean iron, hemoglobulin and hematocrit levels of celiac and Crohn groups were meaningfully lower than the normal and Wilson's group, it was similar in Wilson's and the control group. Serum copper (85 +/- 26 microg/dl, P < 0.158) and ceruloplasmin (219 +/- 83 U/l, P < 0.001) levels were low and 24-h urine copper levels were high (415 +/- 346 microg/day) in Wilson's group. Increased urinary loss may be another cause of copper deficiency in female celiacs besides malabsorption and this topic needs more investigation. Increased urinary copper levels in celiac women should not always be regarded as a diagnosis of Wilson's disease.",2008,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

An 11-year-old Japanese boy presented with ascites associated with biochemical liver damage. Involvement of hepatitis virus was ruled out by laboratory tests. Because urinary copper excretion was increased, Wilson disease was highly suspected, but the serum level of ceruloplasmin was normal, and Kayser-Fleischer rings were not detected by slit lamp examination. Brain images were within normal limits. ATP7B analysis was negative for mutations. Liver specimen showed cirrhosis associated with chronic active hepatitis. Almost all hepatocytes were positive for orcein-stained granules. Mallory bodies were found in some hepatocytes. Fatty change was minimal, and there were no glycogenated nuclei in the parenchyma. Combined regimens of trientine and zinc for 6 months improved the decompensated state of liver function. After 2.5 years of treatment, a second liver biopsy was performed. The post-treatment liver showed complete disappearance of portal inflammation and remarkable decrease in cuprothionein granules. Mallory bodies disappeared from the parenchyma. An abundance of hepatocellular Mallory bodies and heavy copper loading limited to the liver may be specific to idiopathic copper toxicosis.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Laboratory findings showed a normal serum copper level (104 microg/dl), high urinary copper level (2370 microg/dl), and low serum ceruloplasmin level (14.3 microg/dl). Slit-lamp examination revealed Kayser-Fleischer rings on her cornea, and she was diagnosed with Wilson's disease. Plasma exchange and continuous hemodiafiltration relieved the serious condition, after that laparoscopic examination was performed. Administration of D-penicillamine and restriction of dietary copper (<1 mg/day) were started, leading to a normalized serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) level.

Four months prior to the onset of myasthenia, penicillin hypersensitivity was observed. Immunofluorescence on the excised thymus revealed immunoglobulin and complement deposition, but the myasthenia persisted after thymectomy and continuation of penicillamine therapy. Increased antiacetylcholine receptor antibody was demonstrable throughout. This patient subsequently became pregnant, enabling studies to be performed on the transplacental transfer of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antiacetylcholine receptor antibody. Eleven cases of rheumatoid arthritis with penicillamine-associated antistriational antibodies have also been observed; in three of these cases there was evidence of myasthenia gravis. These observations extend earlier reports of the association of penicillamine with myasthenia gravis and suggest that antistriational antibody, antiacetylcholine receptor antibody and thymic hyperplasia may be independent effects of penicillamine therapy.",1977,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

D-penicillamine (DPA) is a heavy metal chelator primarily used for disorders such as cystinuria and Wilson disease. This therapy can lead to induction of EPS through a still unknown mechanism. We report the follow-up of a D-penicillamine-induced EPS in patient with Wilson disease, which prompted us to switch the therapy with trientine (another metal chelator).

We report a case of Wilson's disease with chronic liver disease; moreover, in our patient, presenting also with high levels of state anxiety without depression, 99mTc-ECD-SPECT showed cortical hypoperfusion in frontal lobes, more marked on the left frontal lobe. During the follow-up of our patient, penicillamine was interrupted after the appearance of a lichenoid dermatitis, and zinc acetate permitted to continue the successful treatment of the patient without side-effects. In our case the therapy with zinc acetate represented an effective treatment for a Wilson's disease patient in which penicillamine-related side effects appeared. The safety of the zinc acetate allowed us to avoid other potentially toxic chelating drugs; this observation is in line with the growing evidence on the efficacy of the drug in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Since most of Wilson's disease penicillamine-treated patients do not seem to develop this skin lesion, it could be conceivable that a specific genetic factor is involved in drug response.

Misdiagnosis and delay in treatment are clinically relevant because if left untreated, Wilson's disease progresses to hepatic failure or severe neurologic disability, and death. Those adequately treated have a normal life span. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. Mutations in ATP7B result in abnormal copper metabolism and subsequent toxic accumulation of copper. The clinical manifestations of neurologic Wilson's disease include variable combinations of dysarthria, dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, ataxia, and choreoathetosis.

Mutations at the hZeb2 locus cause Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS), a genetic disorder that is associated with mental retardation and other, case- and sex-dependent clinical features. Recent studies have detailed microRNA-mediated control of Zeb2, but little is known about the genomic context of this gene or of enhancer sequences that may direct its diverse functions. Here, we describe a novel transgenic rodent model in which Zeb2 regulatory sequence has been disrupted, resulting in a postnatal developmental phenotype that is autosomal dominant. The phenotype exhibits a genotype-by-sex interaction and manifests primarily as an acute attenuation of postnatal kidney development in males. Other aspects of embryonic and neonatal development, including neuronal, are unaffected. The transgene insertion site is associated with a 12 kb deletion, 1.2 Mb upstream of Zeb2, within a 4.1 Mb gene desert. A conserved sequence, derived from the deleted region, enhanced Zeb2 promoter activity in transcription assays. Tissue and temporal restriction of this enhancer activity may involve postnatal changes in proteins that bind this sequence. A control human/mouse VISTA enhancer (62 kb upstream of Zeb2) also up-regulated the Zeb2 promoter, providing evidence of a string of conserved distal enhancers. The phenotype arising from deletion of one copy of the extreme long-range enhancer indicates a critical role for this enhancer at one developmental stage. Haploinsufficiency of Zeb2 in this developmental context reflects inheritance of MWS and may underlie some sex-dependent, non-neural characteristics of this human inherited disorder.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
22983845,Copper imbalances in ruminants and humans: unexpected common ground.,Neville F Suttle,"Ruminants are more vulnerable to copper deficiency than humans because rumen sulfide generation lowers copper availability from forage, increasing the risk of conditions such as swayback in lambs. Molybdenum-rich pastures promote thiomolybdate (TM) synthesis and formation of unabsorbable Cu-TM complexes, turning risk to clinical reality (hypocuprosis). Selection pressures created ruminant species with tolerance of deficiency but vulnerability to copper toxicity in alien environments, such as specific pathogen-free units. By contrast, cases of copper imbalance in humans seemed confined to rare genetic aberrations of copper metabolism. Recent descriptions of human swayback and the exploratory use of TM for the treatment of Wilson's disease, tumor growth, inflammatory diseases, and Alzheimer's disease have created unexpected common ground. The incidence of pre-hemolytic copper poisoning in specific pathogen-free lambs was reduced by an infection with Mycobacterium avium that left them more responsive to treatment with TM but vulnerable to long-term copper depletion. Copper requirements in ruminants and humans may need an extra allowance for the ""copper cost"" of immunity to infection. Residual cuproenzyme inhibition in TM-treated lambs and anomalies in plasma copper composition that appeared to depend on liver copper status raise this question ""can chelating capacity be harnessed without inducing copper-deficiency in ruminants or humans?"" A model of equilibria between exogenous (TM) and endogenous chelators (e.g., albumin, metallothionein) is used to predict risk of exposure and hypocuprosis; although risk of natural exposure in humans is remote, vulnerability to TM-induced copper deficiency may be high. Biomarkers of TM impact are needed, and copper chaperones for inhibited cuproenzymes are prime candidates.",2012,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

After treatment the humoral response returned to normal, and in the case of IgA and antibodies to S. typhi O antigen, it even dropped below normal values. The cell-mediated immune response returned to normal with the exception of lymphocyte transformation by PHA and Candida albicans. In in vitro studies it was found that D-penicillamine had no influence on lymphocyte transformation when PHA and Con A were used as mitogens.

Hepatic copper accumulation occurs in a number of cholestatic diseases and they play an important part in pathogenesis and can occasionally lead to neurologic toxic effects.

7766211,Ion efflux systems involved in bacterial metal resistances.,"D H Nies, S Silver","Studying metal ion resistance gives us important insights into environmental processes and provides an understanding of basic living processes. This review concentrates on bacterial efflux systems for inorganic metal cations and anions, which have generally been found as resistance systems from bacteria isolated from metal-polluted environments. The protein products of the genes involved are sometimes prototypes of new families of proteins or of important new branches of known families. Sometimes, a group of related proteins (and presumedly the underlying physiological function) has still to be defined. For example, the efflux of the inorganic metal anion arsenite is mediated by a membrane protein which functions alone in Gram-positive bacteria, but which requires an additional ATPase subunit in some Gram-negative bacteria. Resistance to Cd2+ and Zn2+ in Gram-positive bacteria is the result of a P-type efflux ATPase which is related to the copper transport P-type ATPases of bacteria and humans (defective in the human hereditary diseases Menkes' syndrome and Wilson's disease). In contrast, resistance to Zn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and Cd2+ in Gram-negative bacteria is based on the action of proton-cation antiporters, members of a newly-recognized protein family that has been implicated in diverse functions such as metal resistance/nodulation of legumes/cell division (therefore, the family is called RND).

The liver specimens obtained before and after treatment were studied by X-ray probe microanalysis. After treatment, both copper and sulfur decreased in hepatocellular lysosomes. The estimated molar ratio of the decreased copper to the decreased sulfur was 32/100.

We treated a 28-year-old Japanese woman with Wilson's disease who developed hepatic failure associated with hemolytic crisis just after delivery. She was diagnosed as having Wilson's disease at 12 years of age, at which time she started taking D-penicillamine. She had previously delivered two children without difficulty. When she found out she was pregnant this time, she stopped taking D-penicillamine in contrast to taking it faithfully during her first two pregnancies. On the day of delivery of her full-term baby, jaundice developed accompanied with severe hemolytic crisis. Plasma exchanges and blood transfusion were performed and D-penicillamine administration was started again. She gradually recovered and apparently was following a good clinical course. However, on day 30 the second hemolytic crisis occurred and subsequent liver failure led her to death on day 50. At autopsy her liver was cirrhotic and showed massive necrosis. Prophylactic oral administration of D-penicillamine and careful observation are therefore recommended to prevent hemolytic crisis during the perinatal period.",1991,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Forty-nine children with Wilson's disease under the age of 15 were treated with D-penicillamine for 2 to 15 years. None of the presymptomatic patients subsequently developed any symptoms of the disease. The results of treatment in patients who had exhibited only hepatic symptoms were also excellent.

Striatal rCMRGlc was significantly reduced in those 4 patients who had recently started decoppering therapy as compared with striatal rCMRGlc measured in those 10 patients with longer duration of medication. Caudate rCMRGlc correlated significantly with various signs of extrapyramidal dysfunction. Cerebellar, thalamic and cortical rCMRGlc correlated significantly with the severity of pyramidal signs.

CSF copper levels decreased slowly over the years in parallel with clinical improvements, and increased in one patient who interrupted therapy for 2 years. These findings confirm our hypothesis that the concentration of copper in the CSF is a valuable quantitative parameter reflecting the normalization of copper in the brain.

The patients were scanned using spin-echo (SE) sequences; the neurologist was looking for typical symptoms: dysarthria, tremor, ataxia, rigidity/bradykinesia and chorea/dystonia. Pathological MR findings believed secondary to this uncommon inherited disorder of copper metabolism were found in twenty-two subjects. Focal abnormalities were seen in the lenticular, thalamic and caudate nuclei as well as in brain stem and white matter; these lesions were best demonstrated on T2-weighted sequences as hyperintense areas. In eight patients we found diffuse brain atrophy with consecutive widening of the ventricular system. Five subjects showed mild, nineteen severe neurologic deficits. Generally there was no correlation between MR findings and clinical neurological symptoms; the impairment of cell-metabolism causing functional alterations of the brain precedes morphological changes. During treatment with the copper chelator D-penicillamine there seemed to be a phased course of disease. Shortening of T1-relaxation due to paramagnetic influence of copper was not seen; a possible explanation could be intracellular deposition--a proton-electron-dipolar-dipolar-interaction would therefore be impossible.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

24160731,"Iron, zinc, and copper in retinal physiology and disease.","Marta Ugarte, Neville N Osborne, Laurence A Brown, Paul N Bishop","The essential trace metals iron, zinc, and copper play important roles both in retinal physiology and disease. They are involved in various retinal functions such as phototransduction, the visual cycle, and the process of neurotransmission, being tightly bound to proteins and other molecules to regulate their structure and/or function or as unbound free metal ions. Elevated levels of ""free"" or loosely bound metal ions can exert toxic effects, and in order to maintain homeostatic levels to protect retinal cells from their toxicity, appropriate mechanisms exist such as metal transporters, chaperones, and the presence of certain storage molecules that tightly bind metals to form nontoxic products. The pathways to maintain homeostatic levels of metals are closely interlinked, with various metabolic pathways directly and/or indirectly affecting their concentrations, compartmentalization, and oxidation/reduction states. Retinal deficiency or excess of these metals can result from systemic depletion and/or overload or from mutations in genes involved in maintaining retinal metal homeostasis, and this is associated with retinal dysfunction and pathology. Iron accumulation in the retina, a characteristic of aging, may be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Zinc deficiency is associated with poor dark adaptation. Zinc levels in the human retina and RPE decrease with age in AMD. Copper deficiency is associated with optic neuropathy, but retinal function is maintained. The changes in iron and zinc homeostasis in AMD have led to the speculation that iron chelation and/or zinc supplements may help in its treatment.",2013,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
29163329,Dystonic Dysarthria in Wilson Disease: Efficacy of Zolpidem.,"Aurélia Poujois, Michaela Pernon, Jean-Marc Trocello, France Woimant","Wilson disease (WD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by copper overload in the liver and the brain. Neurological presentations are mainly related to the accumulation of copper in the basal ganglia, the brainstem, and the cerebellum. Dysarthria is a frequent symptom, with dystonic, spastic, or parkinsonian components and is usually resistant to medical or voice rehabilitation therapies. Here, we report the case of a patient with WD diagnosed at the age of 12, who presented a severe and constant dysarthria from dystonic origin which was unresponsive to benzodiazepines and anticholinergic drugs. When she was 25-year-old, she tried zolpidem at bedtime for sleeping difficulties and reported a paradoxical effect of this drug on her voice. To confirm the effect of zolpidem on her dystonic dysarthria, we realized a full evaluation of her dysarthria at baseline without zolpidem and after 4 days of treatment by 10 mg twice a day. Lexical access was evaluated by the semantic fluency; dysarthria by the Intelligibility Score, the spontaneous speech and reading rates, the maximum phonation time on the sustained vowel [a] and by a perceptive evaluation. Two hours after the intake of zolpidem, improvement of all the parameters tested, with the exception of the maximum phonation time, was observed. Semantic fluency increased by 59%, the spontaneous speech rate by 88% and the reading rate by 76%. General dystonia remained unchanged and the tolerance of zolpidem was satisfactory. Since then, the patient takes zolpidem 5 mg five times a day, and 4 years later shows persistent improvement in oral communication and a good drug tolerance. In this single-case study, we showed that regular daytime intake of zolpidem could have a persisting effect on a complex dystonic dysarthria that was resistant to usual medical treatments.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

29098318,[Wilson's disease : What has been confirmed in diagnostic and therapy?].,E-D Pfister,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal copper accumulation. Presenting a broad variety of phenotypes and, thus, being a chameleon within the group of metabolic diseases, the manifold clinical symptoms of WD can include hepatologic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations. Early onset presentations in infancy and late-onset manifestations in adults older than 70 years of age have been described. If the typical laboratory blood test values are missing, the diagnosis of WD may be difficult and often involves a combination of different parameters. Novel test methods like the identification of the relative exchangeable copper have not been validated within a sufficient cohort of WD patients as of yet and therefore do not currently play a crucial role within the clinical setting. Consequently any patient with reasonable suspected diagnosis of WD needs to be presented to a (pediatric) gastroenterologist and/or (pediatric) neurologist. Different medical treatments including drugs such as copper chelating agents are commonly used in the clinical setting. Liver transplantation may be the ultima ratio in selected patients. Dietary changes involving a low copper diet play only a minor role. Due to the fact the use of tetrathiomolybdate is still not approved, the treatment of advanced and progressive neurologic symptoms remains a major challenge. In any case, life-long medical supervision and treatment governed by a specialist is absolutely essential. Early diagnosis and early and life-long treatment lead to better prognoses and do not negatively influence the overall life expectancy.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Because of the low disease frequency, the existing treatment concepts are not based on controlled trails. Here, recent outcome reports of larger cohort studies challenge the recommended therapies and call for individualized treatment strategies.

Wilson disease can be treated with pharmacologic agents, such as chelators that induce urinary excretion of copper or zinc salts that inhibit copper absorption in the digestive tract. Liver transplant is the only treatment option for Wilson disease when liver failure has occurred. In some patients, that is, in those with Child-Pugh A score, neurologic disease can be seen without hepatic failure. Our recommendation is for these patients to have auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant. Here, we present a 36-year-old male patient with neurologic disease associated with Wilson disease who had successful related living-donor auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant using a left lobe. The patient, as a result of neurologic symptoms that included tremor walking and speaking problems and low serum ceruloplasmin level of 7 mg/dL, was diagnosed with Wilson disease, and a liver biopsy was performed. Chronic necroinflammatory disease activity was 4/18, and the patient received chelation treatment. His hepatic functions were normal. The donor was the patient's 57-year-old father whose liver function tests were also normal. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1% using a left lobe graft. After transplant, serum ceruloplasmin levels on day 15 and month 1 were 14 and 19 mg/dL. At month 1, liver function tests were normal. Doppler ultrasonography showed normal vascular flow of the native liver and the graft. The patient's neurologic symptoms were progressively reduced. Progressive neurologic deterioration with no hepatic insufficiency is considered a suitable indication for auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplant; this procedure is suggested before the neurologic and liver failure symptoms of Wilson disease occur.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Excessive cell death is the cause of many degenerative diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders and Wilson's disease, for which current therapies remain insufficient.

The latter can be obtained by either decreasing the presence of the toxic trigger (like protein aggregation in case of many commonly known neurodegenerative diseases) or by blocking death-inducing signaling cascade(s). Given the high conservation in PCD processes between yeast and mammalian cells, in this review, we will focus on yeast as a model organism to study PCD-related diseases as well as on its use for drug discovery purposes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between OCT parameters and the progression of neurological signs measured by the Unified Wilson's Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS) in patients with WD. Consecutive patients with WD admitted to the Department of Neurology underwent OCT to assess the thickness of the macula and total RNFL. Patients also had neurologic assessments according to the UWDRS part III. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence (UWDRS+) and absence (UWDRS-) of neurological symptoms. Fifty-eight patients (34 females, 24 males) were enrolled. Mean duration of treatment was 9 years (standard deviation [SD], ±10.8). The mean UWDRS score at the time of study was 8.4 (range 1-52; SD ±13.9) points. Total RNFL as well as macula thickness were significantly decreased in the UWDRS+ group versus the UWDRS- group.

21893209,Iron and copper in fetal development.,"Lorraine Gambling, Christine Kennedy, Harry J McArdle","Copper and iron are both essential micronutrients. Because they can both accept and donate electrons, they are central to many energy dependent chemical reactions. For example, copper is a critical part of ferroxidase enzymes ceruloplasmin, hephaestin and zyklopen, as well as enzymes such as dopamine-β-monoxygenase, while iron is part of the catalytic site of many cytochromes and enzymes involved in fatty acid desaturation. Unsurprisingly, therefore, copper and iron deficiency, especially during pregnancy, when cell proliferation and differentiation are very active, sub-optimal nutrient status can lead to serious consequences. These problems can persist into adulthood, with an increased risk of mental problems such as schizophrenia and, in animal models at least, hypertension and obesity. In this review, we consider what these problems are and how they may arise. We examine the role of copper and iron deficiencies separately during fetal development, in terms of birth outcome and then how problems with status in utero can have long term sequelae for the offspring. We examine several possible mechanisms of action, both direct and indirect. Direct causes include, for example, reduced enzyme activity, while indirect ones may result from changes in cytokine activity, reductions in cell number or increased apoptosis, to name but a few. We examine a very important area of nutrition-interactions between the micronutrients and conclude that, while we have made significant advances in understanding the relationship between micronutrient status and pregnancy outcome, there is still much to be learned.",2011,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Its incidence is higher in China than in western countries. ATP7B is the causative gene and encodes a P-type ATPase, which participates in the synthesis of holoceruloplasmin and copper excretion. Disease-causing variants of ATP7B disrupt the normal structure or function of the enzyme and cause copper deposition in multiple organs, leading to diverse clinical manifestations. Given the variety of presentations, misdiagnosis is not rare. Genetic diagnosis plays an important role and has gradually become a routine test in China. The first Chinese spectrum of disease-causing mutations of ATP7B has been established. As a remediable hereditary disorder, most WD patients have a good prognosis with an early diagnosis and chelation treatment. However, clinical trials are relatively few in China, and most treatments are based on the experience of experts and evidences from other countries.

Future research using modern chemical methods will focus more on elemental speciation and on measuring lower concentrations leading to further identifying adverse effects and critical organs. Extensive knowledge about essentiality and toxicity of trace elements in humans has emerged during the last two decades and at present the difficulties in defining a range of acceptable oral intakes for essential elements has largely been overcome. Biological monitoring of trace element concentrations in various media such as blood or urine is of great importance and an overview is given.

Genetically determined familial NWHD is rare, poorly understood, and often mistaken for Wilson's disease (WD). We analysed clinical and MRI profiles of NWHD patients who did not have obvious cause for acquired liver disease, such as alcohol intake or hepatitis. Six patients from four families (four males, two females, mean age: 17.0±standard deviation 7.9years), presenting with chronic extrapyramidal disorder resembling WD and imaging (abdominal ultrasound/MRI) evidence of cirrhosis were studied. They lacked Kayser-Fleischer rings or biochemical and/or genetic evidence of WD. Clinical features included dystonia (n=6), parkinsonism (n=3), tremor (n=1), cerebellar ataxia (n=3), orofacial dyskinesia (n=1), behavioural abnormalities (n=3), and cognitive decline (n=1). Brain MRI revealed T1-weighted hyperintensity in the pallidum (n=6), crus cerebri (n=4), putamen (n=1), caudate (n=1), thalamus (n=1), and red nucleus (n=1) with T2-weighted shortening in some of these regions. Additional findings included giant cisterna magna (n=1), face of giant panda sign (n=1) and thin corpus callosum (n=1). Areas of ""blooming"" on susceptibility weighted images were noted in two patients in the caudate (n=2) and putamen (n=1). The finding of T1 shortening is distinct from that of WD where the majority of lesions are T1-hypointense and T2-hyperintense. Extrapallidal T1-hyperintensity is also an exceptional observation in NWHD. The MRI appearance of intense T1 shortening coupled with the lack of increased susceptibility changes suggests that the most likely mineral deposited is manganese. The association of this neurological disorder and cirrhosis of the liver in the absence of an acquired liver disease is a distinct disease entity. This syndrome may represent a disorder of manganese metabolism resulting in its toxic deposition.",2016,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
26861285,Canine Models for Copper Homeostasis Disorders.,"Xiaoyan Wu, Peter A J Leegwater, Hille Fieten","Copper is an essential trace nutrient metal involved in a multitude of cellular processes. Hereditary defects in copper metabolism result in disorders with a severe clinical course such as Wilson disease and Menkes disease. In Wilson disease, copper accumulation leads to liver cirrhosis and neurological impairments. A lack in genotype-phenotype correlation in Wilson disease points toward the influence of environmental factors or modifying genes. In a number of Non-Wilsonian forms of copper metabolism, the underlying genetic defects remain elusive. Several pure bred dog populations are affected with copper-associated hepatitis showing similarities to human copper metabolism disorders. Gene-mapping studies in these populations offer the opportunity to discover new genes involved in copper metabolism. Furthermore, due to the relatively large body size and long life-span of dogs they are excellent models for development of new treatment strategies. One example is the recent use of canine organoids for disease modeling and gene therapy of copper storage disease. This review addresses the opportunities offered by canine genetics for discovery of genes involved in copper metabolism disorders. Further, possibilities for the use of dogs in development of new treatment modalities for copper storage disorders, including gene repair in patient-derived hepatic organoids, are highlighted.",2016,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

As a key regulator of epithelial mesenchymal differentiation, ZEB2 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer, and its high level expression has been observed in glioma patients. Different mutations in this gene have been identified in patients with Mowat-Wilson syndrome. A previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of schizophrenia conducted in Caucasians has shown a significant association of rs12991836, located near the ZEB2 gene, with schizophrenia. Thus, we conducted a case control study to further investigate whether this genomic region is also a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia in the Han Chinese population. In total, 1248 schizophrenia (SCZ) cases (mean age±S.D., 36.44±9.0years), 1344 bipolar disorder (BPD) cases (mean age±S.D., 34.84±11.44years), 1056 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases (mean age±S.D., 34.41±12.09years) and 1248 healthy control samples (mean age±S.D., 30.62±11.35years) were recruited. We genotyped 12 SNPs using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform in this study.

There are numerous diseases that are caused by protein misfolding, mainly due to mutations in the respective gene. The consequences of this misfolding may be that proteins effectively lose their function, either by being removed by the cellular quality control machinery or by accumulating at the incorrect intracellular or extracellular location. A number of mutations that lead to protein misfolding and affect trafficking to the final destination, e.g. Cystic fibrosis, Wilson's disease, and Progressive Familial Intrahepatic 1 cholestasis, result in proteins that retain partial function if their folding and trafficking is restored either by molecular or pharmacological means.

Here we demonstrate that zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (Zeb2, also called Sip1) transcription factor is a critical intrinsic timer that controls the onset of SC differentiation by recruiting histone deacetylases HDAC 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) and nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex (NuRD) co-repressor complexes in mice. Zeb2 deletion arrests SCs at an undifferentiated state during peripheral nerve development and inhibits remyelination after injury. Zeb2 antagonizes inhibitory effectors including Notch and Sox2. Importantly, genome-wide transcriptome analysis reveals a Zeb2 target gene encoding the Notch effector Hey2 as a potent inhibitor for Schwann cell differentiation. Strikingly, a genetic Zeb2 variant associated with Mowat-Wilson syndrome disrupts the interaction with HDAC1/2-NuRD and abolishes Zeb2 activity for SC differentiation. Therefore, Zeb2 controls SC maturation by recruiting HDAC1/2-NuRD complexes and inhibiting a Notch-Hey2 signaling axis, pointing to the critical role of HDAC1/2-NuRD activity in peripheral neuropathies caused by ZEB2 mutations.",2016,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Its CNS symptoms represent a serious problem, since therapeutics for Wilson's disease do not cross the BBB. One strategy to overcome this obstacle is the transfer of drugs across the BBB with colloidal carrier systems like liposomes. The aim of the present study was to encapsulate triethylenetetramine (TETA), a copper chelating agent, into surface modified liposomes and to investigate their permeation across the BBB. Liposomes were modified with cationized bovine serum albumin or penetratin, a cell penetrating peptide. Liposomes were characterized regarding size, PDI, zeta potential and encapsulation efficiency. Size was between 139.4±1.9nm to 171.1±3.5nm with PDI's below 0.2. Zeta potentials of vectorized liposomes were at least 6.9mV higher than those of standard liposomes. Cryo-TEM micrographs displayed liposomal structure, integrity and the similarity of structure and size between loaded, unloaded, vectorized and non- vectorized liposomes. In vivo experiments in rats showed an up to 16-fold higher brain uptake of TETA in vectorized liposomes compared to free TETA or TETA in non-vectorized liposomes, proving successful brain delivery using target seeking surface modifications.

The clinical use of the old chelators EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetate) and BAL (2,3-dimercaptopropanol) is now limited due to the inconvenience of parenteral administration, their own toxicity and tendency to increase the neurotoxicity of several metals. The hydrophilic dithiol chelators DMSA (meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) and DMPS (2,3-dimercapto-propanesulphonate) are less toxic and more efficient than BAL in the clinical treatment of heavy metal poisoning, and available as capsules for oral use. In copper overload, DMSA appears to be a potent antidote, although d-penicillamine is still widely used. In the chelation of iron, the thiols are inefficient, since iron has higher affinity for ligands with nitrogen and oxygen, but the new oral iron antidotes deferiprone and desferasirox have entered into the clinical arena.

The estimated prevalence for liver-related osteoporosis is between 20-420/100000 of the general population, and fractures between 60-880/100000. It should be kept in mind that up to 40% of patients with chronic liver disease may experience a fracture. The pathogenic mediators include fibronectin, insulin like growth factor-I, and various cytokines, but decreased vitamin D and/or treatment with corticosteroids contribute to worsening bone health. Despite the advances in bone biology that have shed some light on the pathogenesis of this bone loss, treatment options remain nonspecific and tightly linked to treatments of other forms of osteoporosis. Thus, treatment should include calcium and vitamin D supplementation in all patients with chronic liver disease. Therapy with bisphosphonates should be considered, especially in patients receiving corticosteroids. This review focuses on the prevalence of this entity as well as the evidence available with regard to the pathogenesis of bone loss in liver disease, the diagnostic steps required in all patients, and the therapeutic options available.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

RT-nested PCR product sequencing comparison showed that c.3244-2A>C splice-site mutation caused aberrant transcripts and formatted a new splice acceptor. Patient carrying the splice-site mutation c.3244-2A>C presented early onset age, severe clinical manifestations, and poor prognosis.

We have previously shown that ATN-224, a copper chelator drug, induces cell death in murine thymic lymphoma cells transfected with Bcl-2. In the current study, we tested whether ATN-224 was effective in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells, which have increased anti‑apoptotic proteins through translocation or amplification. We found that nanomolar concentrations of ATN-224 induced cell death in DLBCL cells independent of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 status. ATN-224 treatment resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and induction of caspase-independent cell death. In addition, ATN-224 degraded Mcl-1 and enhanced the effect of the BH3 mimetic ABT-263. These findings indicate that ATN-224 has potential as a therapeutic for the treatment of DLBCL. Induction of caspase‑independent cell death in apoptosis‑resistant DLBCL would provide a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of refractory disease.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Presentations with psychotic symptoms have been described less frequently. In this report we present the case of a young boy with Wilson's disease who developed psychotic symptoms. A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease on the basis of the physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). After 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset illness, characterized by delusion of persecution, fearfulness, hypervigilence and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of the symptoms he was prescribed tab penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increase in the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started, and the dose of penicillamine was reduced with which symptoms resolved. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, especially of delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease must be considered.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

To the best of our knowledge, there have been five fulminant WD patients with RWPI ≥ 11 including the present patient, in whom LTx was not done.

Conventional auxiliary liver transplantation for WD is orthotopic liver transplantation and heterotopic liver transplantation. But the conventional procedure could not avoid the problem of space, functional competition, hemodynamic variation. Here we report a case of heterotopic auxiliary living-donor liver transplantation (HALDLT) to treat WD. We modified the operation to have a splenectomy, implant graft into the splenic fossa. The patient recovered well after the transplantation and has been symptom-free during a 5-year follow-up. This modified operation is more safe and simple.

We propose a gentle therapy to eliminate the excessive copper content with oral administration of insoluble non-resorbable polymer sorbents containing selective chelating groups for copper(II). Polymeric beads with the chelating agents triethylenetetramine, N,N-di(2-pyridylmethyl)amine, and 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQB) were investigated. In a preliminary copper uptake experiment, we found that 8HQB significantly reduced copper uptake (using copper-64 as a radiotracer) after oral administration in Wistar rats. Furthermore, we measured organ radioactivity in rats to demonstrate that 8HQB radiolabelled with iodine-125 is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Non-resorbability and the blockade of copper uptake were also confirmed with small animal imaging (PET/CT) in mice. In a long-term experiment with Wistar rats fed a diet containing the polymers, we have found that there were no signs of polymer toxicity and the addition of polymers to the diet led to a significant reduction in the copper contents in the kidneys, brains, and livers of the rats. We have shown that polymers containing specific ligands could potentially be novel therapeutics for Wilson's disease.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Recent studies have indicated that alteration of copper metabolism is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In light of these findings, many researchers have proposed preventive strategies to reduce AD risk. Because the general population comes in contact with copper mainly through dietary intake, that is, food 75% and drinking water 25%, a low-copper diet can reduce the risk of AD in individuals with an altered copper metabolism. We suggest that a diet-gene interplay is at the basis of the ""copper phenotype"" of sporadic AD. Herein, we describe the pathways regulating copper homeostasis, the adverse sequelae related to its derangements, the pathogenic mechanism of the AD copper phenotype, indications for a low-copper diet, and future perspectives to improve this preventive strategy.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The incidence is increasing rapidly, but only in developed countries. We postulate that the new emerging environmental factor partially causal of the AD epidemic is ingestion of inorganic copper from drinking water and taking supplement pills, along with a high fat diet. Inorganic copper can be partially directly absorbed and elevate the serum free copper pool. The Squitti group has shown that serum free copper is elevated in AD, correlates with cognition, and predicts cognition loss. Thus, our inorganic copper hypothesis fits well with the Squitti group data. We have also shown that AD patients are zinc deficient compared to age-matched controls. Because zinc is a neuronal protective factor, we postulate that zinc deficiency may also be partially causative of AD. We carried out a small 6 month double blind study of a new zinc formulation and found that in patients age 70 and over, it protected against cognition loss. Zinc therapy also significantly reduced serum free copper in AD patients, so efficacy may come from restoring normal zinc levels, or from lowering serum free copper, or from both.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

These show a gradual accumulation and concentration of Cu in liver, kidneys, and brain. However, still little is known about the regional distribution of Cu inside the brain, its influence on other metals and subsequent pathophysiological mechanisms. We have applied laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and performed comparative metal bio-imaging in brain sections of wild type and Atp7b null mice in the age range of 11-24 months.

Previous findings suggested a potential role of additional genetic modifiers and environment factors on phenotypic expression among the affected patients. We conducted clinical and genetic investigations to perform genotype-phenotype correlation in two large families living in a socio-culturally isolated community with the highest prevalence of Wilson's disease ever reported of 1 ∶ 1130. Sequencing of ATP7B gene in seven affected individuals and 43 family members identified a common compound heterozygous genotype, H1069Q/M769H-fs, in five symptomatic and two asymptomatic patients and detected the presence of two out of seven identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in all affected patients. Symptomatic patients had similar clinical phenotype and age at onset (18 ± 1 years) showing dysarthria and dysphagia as common clinical features at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, all symptomatic patients presented Kayser-Fleischer rings and lack of dystonia accompanied by unfavourable clinical outcomes. Our findings add value for understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations in Wilson's disease based on a multifamily study in an isolated population with high extent of genetic and environmental homogeneity as opposed to majority of reports. We observed an equal influence of presumed other genetic modifiers and environmental factors on clinical presentation and age at onset of Wilson's disease in patients with a particular genotype.

In this disease, inadequate hepatic excretion leads to copper accumulation in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. Severe neurological symptoms can develop in patients with WD, often in the absence of relevant liver damage: it is unclear whether liver transplantation (LT) could reverse neurological symptoms, and at present LT is not recommended in this setting. We report a case of regression of neurological symptoms in a patient affected by WD with prevalent neurological involvement. A 19-year-old man with disabling neuropsychiatric symptoms from WD that included frontal ataxia, akinesia, dystonia, tremors, and behavioral disorders in the presence of preserved liver function (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score=7; Child-Turcotte-Pugh score=A5) underwent LT in November 2009. At the time of LT, encephalic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated diffuse neurodegenerative alterations involving subtentorial and supratentorial structures; bilateral Kayser-Fleischer ring was present. Four years after LT, laboratory tests show normalized copper metabolism and excellent liver function test results. Encephalic MRI shows a substantial improvement of already-known signal alterations at nuclei thalamus and putamen, mesencephalon, and pons. Kayser-Fleischer ring disappeared from the right eye, but a little remnant is still visible in the left eye. At neurological examination, all of the previous symptoms and signs are no longer present and behavioral disorders are no longer present; psychosocial functions are completely restored. The present case provides some evidence that LT may be a valid therapeutic option for WD patients with marked neurological impairment, particularly in those no longer responsive to chelation therapy.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Medically refractory idiopathic dystonia and essential tremor (ET) have been successfully treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS), functional surgical therapy targeting the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi), or the ventral intermediate (Vim) thalamic nucleus. Even though the pathophysiology of tremor is different in WD and ET, available experience supports DBS targeting the Vim for WD patients. Dystonia associated with WD is classified as secondary dystonia and GPi stimulation has yielded mixed results in these patients. The presence of structural changes in the basal ganglia may limit the therapeutic success of DBS for WD dystonia compared with idiopathic dystonia.

Cu chelators and zinc salts are the two most important drugs used in the treatment of WD patients; however, the molecular mechanisms of the drugs with regard to ATP7B expression have not been determined. A targeted knockout of ATP7B (KO) was established in the most widely used human hepatoma cell line, HepG2 for molecular studies of the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease. KO cells showed similar growth, Cu uptake, release, and gene expression as compared to parental cells. However, in the presence of Cu, morphological changes, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and loss of viability were observed. Induction of metallothionein (MT1X) after Cu exposure was significantly reduced in KO cells. Following zinc treatment, MT1X expression was strongly induced and a high percentage of KO cells could be rescued from Cu induced toxicity. D-penicillamine treatment had a minor effect on the viability of KO cells whereas the parental cell line showed a pronounced improvement. Combined treatment displayed a highly synergistic effect in KO cells. The data suggest that zinc has a previously unrecognized effect on the viability of hepatocytes that lack ATP7B due to a high induction of MT1X expression that compensates low gene expression after Cu exposure. A combination therapy that simultaneously targets at MT1X induction and Cu chelation improves the overall survival of hepatocytes for most efficient therapy of patients having WD.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Since the corresponding ATPase is in charge of copper (Cu) distribution and excretion in the liver, its malfunctioning leads to Cu overload. This short review deals with treatments of this rare disease, which aim at decreasing Cu toxicity and are, therefore, based on chelation therapy. The drugs used since the 1950s are described first, then a novel approach developed in our laboratory is presented. Since the liver is the main organ of Cu distribution in the body, we targeted the pool of intracellular Cu in hepatocytes. This Cu pool is in the +1 oxidation state, and therefore soft sulfur ligands inspired from binding sites found in metallothioneins were developed. Their targeting to the hepatocytes by functionalization with ligands of the asialoglycoprotein receptor led to their cellular incorporation and intracellular Cu chelation.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

25145892,Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable inborn errors of metabolism.,S Nia,"Possible underlying organic causes of psychiatric symptoms can be overlooked in the clinical setting. It is important to increase awareness amongst psychiatric and neurological professionals with regard to certain inborn errors of metabolism as, in some cases, disease-specific therapies are available that can, for instance, treat underlying metabolic causes. The following article describes the basic pathophysiology, clinical and neurological features, and available diagnostic procedures of six treatable metabolic diseases that are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms: Wilson's disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, porphyrias, homocysteinemia, urea cycle disorders, and Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). NP-C is taken as a particularly relevant example because, while it is traditionally considered to be a condition that presents with severe neurological and systemic manifestations in children, an increasing number of patients are being detected who have the adolescent- or adult-onset form, which is frequently associated with neuropsychiatric signs. A notable proportion of adult-onset cases have been reported where NP-C has mistakenly been diagnosed and treated as a psychiatric condition, usually based on patients' initial presentation with psychotic or schizophrenia-like symptoms. Underlying organic causes of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis should be considered among patients with atypical symptoms and/or resistance to standard therapy.

Copper is one of the first metals used by humans, the first artifacts dating back 10,000 years ago. Currently, the world production of refined copper exceeds 16,000 tons/year. Copper is a micro-element essential to life, principally for its red-ox properties that make it a necessary cofactor for many enzymes, like cytochrome-c oxidase and superoxide dismutase. In some animal species (e.g. octopus, snails, spiders, oysters) copper-hemocyanins also act as carriers of oxygen instead of hemoglobin. However, these red-ox properties also make the pair Cu(+)/Cu(2+) a formidable catalyst for the formation of reactive oxygen species, when copper is present in excess in the body or in tissues. The treatment of choice in cases of copper overloading or intoxication is the chelation therapy. Different molecules are already in clinical use as chelators or under study or clinical trial. It is worth noting that chelation therapy has also been suggested to treat some neurodegenerative diseases or cardiovascular disorders. In this review, after a brief description of the homeostasis and some cases of dyshomeostasis of copper, the main (used or potential) chelators are described; their properties in solution, even in relation to the presence of metal or ligand competitors, under physiological conditions, are discussed. The legislation of the most important Western countries, regarding both the use of chelating agents and the limits of copper in foods, drugs and cosmetics, is also outlined.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Bone marrow aspirate done to evaluate the cause of bicytopenia revealed trilineage dysplasia. Correlating the clinical context with bone marrow and biochemical parameters, copper deficiency was suspected and he was given a trial of therapy, following which the hematological parameters improved. This case highlights hypocupremia as a reversible cause of bone marrow dysplasia in patients with Wilson's disease on chelation, where serum copper levels are not useful in the diagnosis. We also believe that monitoring of the blood counts in patients on copper chelation may provide a clue to impending copper deficiency.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

A competitive ELISA was established using a specific polyclonal antibody against rat MT-2. The antibody used for this ELISA had exhibited the same cross-reactivity with MT in humans and experimental animals. The NH2 terminal peptide of MT containing acetylated methionine was shown to be the epitope of this antibody. The reactivity of this ELISA system with the liver, kidney and brain in MT1/2 knock-out mice was significantly low, but was normal in an MT-3 knock-out mouse. The lowest detection limit of this ELISA was 0.6ng/ml and the spiked MT-1was fully recovered from the plasma. We investigated the normal range of MT1/2 (25-75%tile) in 200 healthy human serum and found it to be 27-48ng/ml, and this was compared with the serum levels in various liver diseases. The serum MT1/2 levels in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) patients were significantly lower than healthy controls and also other liver diseases. In the chronic hepatitis cases, the MT1/I2 levels increased gradually, followed by the progression of the disease to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In particular, we found significantly elevated MT1/2 plasma levels in Wilson's disease patients, levels which were very similar to those in the Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat (model animal of Wilson's disease). Furthermore, a significantly elevated MT1/2 level was found in patients with Menkes disease, an inborn error of copper metabolism such as Wilson's disease.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
24450973,Pathogenesis and management of Wilson disease.,Masaru Harada,"Hepatolenticular degeneration, commonly known as Wilson disease, is an autosomal recessive inherited disease of abnormal copper metabolism, characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body due to decreased biliary excretion of copper from hepatocytes. Wilson disease protein, ATP7B, functions in copper excretion into bile and in copper secretion to the bloodstream coupled with ceruloplasmin synthesis. Various kinds of mutations of ATP7B cause Wilson disease. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disease that can be treated pharmacologically. Recognition and prompt diagnosis are very important, because Wilson disease is fatal if left untreated.

Initial magnetic resonance examination was performed in 37 patients with proven neurological form of Wilson's disease with cerebellar, parkinsonian and dystonic presentation. Magnetic resonance reexamination was done 5.7 ± 1.3 years later in 14 patients. Patients were divided into: group A, where chelating therapy was initiated < 24 months from the first symptoms and group B, where the therapy started ≥ 24 months after the initial symptoms. Symmetry of the lesions was seen in 100% of patients. There was a significant difference between groups A and B regarding complete resolution of brain stem and putaminal lesions (P = 0.005 and P = 0.024, respectively). If the correct diagnosis and adequate treatment are not established less than 24 months after onset of the symptoms, irreversible lesions in the brain parenchyma could be expected. Signal abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging might therefore, at least in the early stages, represent reversible myelinolisis or cytotoxic edema associated with copper toxicity.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

It is caused by de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations including nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, and deletions in ZEB2 at 2q22. ZEB2 encodes the zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 protein consisting of 1,214 amino acids. Herein, we report 13 nonsense and 27 frameshift mutations from 40 newly identified MWS patients in Japan. Although the clinical findings of all the Japanese MWS patients with nonsense and frameshift mutations were quite similar to the previous review reports of MWS caused by nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations and deletions of ZEB2, the frequencies of microcephaly, Hirschsprung disease, and urogenital/renal anomalies were small. Patients harbored mutations spanning the region between the amino acids 55 and 1,204 in wild-type ZEB2. There was no obvious genotype-phenotype correlation among the patients. A transfection study demonstrated that the cellular level of the longest form of the mutant ZEB2 protein harboring the p.D1204Rfs*29 mutation was remarkably low. The results showed that the 3'-end frameshift mutation of ZEB2 causes MWS due to ZEB2 instability.",2014,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

26626635,The role of zinc in liver cirrhosis.,"Kurt Grüngreiff, Dirk Reinhold, Heiner Wedemeyer","Zinc is an essential trace element playing fundamental roles in cellular metabolism. It acts mostly by binding a wide range of proteins, thus affecting a broad spectrum of biological processes, which include cell division, growth and differentiation. Zinc is critical to a large number of structural proteins, enzymatic processes, and transcription factors. Zinc deficiency can result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, such as poor of appetite, loss of body hair, altered taste and smell, testicular atrophy, cerebral and immune dysfunction, and diminished drug elimination capacity. These are common symptoms in patients with chronic liver diseases, especially liver cirrhosis. The liver is the main organ responsible for the zinc metabolism which can be affected by liver diseases. On the other hand, zinc deficiency may alter hepatocyte functions and also immune responses in inflammatory liver diseases. Liver cirrhosis represents the most advanced stage of chronic liver diseases and is the common outcome of chronic liver injury. It is associated with energy malnutrition, with numerous metabolic disorders, such as hypoalbuminemia, with imbalance between branched-chain amino acids and aromatic amino acids, and with reduced zinc serum concentrations. All these processes can influence the clinical outcome of patients, such ascites, hepatic encephalopathy and hepatocellular carcinoma.

Heterozygous mutations or deletions in the zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox2 gene (ZEB2) cause MWS. ZEB2 encodes for Smad-interacting protein 1, a transcriptional co-repressor involved in TGF-beta and BMP pathways and is strongly expressed in early stages of development in mice. Eye abnormalities have rarely been described in patients with this syndrome. Herein, we describe four patients (two males and two females; mean age 7 years) with MWS and eye malformations. Ocular anomalies included, iris/retinal colobomas, atrophy or absence of the optic nerve, hyphema, and deep refraction troubles, sometimes with severe visual consequences. All eye malformations were asymmetric and often unilateral and all eye segments were affected, similarly to the nine MWS cases with ophthalmological malformations previously reported (iris/chorioretinal/optic disc coloboma, optic nerve atrophy, retinal epithelium atrophy, cataract, and korectopia). In human embryo, ZEB2 is expressed in lens and neural retina. Using the present report and data from the literature, we set out to determine whether or not the presence of eye manifestations could be due to specific type or location of mutations.

However, current research reveals an important synaptic function of APP and APP-like proteins (APLP1 and 2). In this context various neurotrophic and neuroprotective functions have been reported for the APP proteolytic fragments sAPPα, sAPPβ and the monomeric amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). APP is a metalloprotein and binds copper and zinc ions. Synaptic activity correlates with a release of these ions into the synaptic cleft and dysregulation of their homeostasis is linked to different neurodegenerative diseases. Metal binding to APP or its fragments affects its structure and its proteolytic cleavage and therefore its physiological function at the synapse. Here, we summarize the current data supporting this hypothesis and provide a model of how these different mechanisms might be intertwined with each other.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Apoptosis is also responsible for neuronal death after traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, stroke, and seizures. The cognitive and behavioral consequences of all of these disorders can be devastating. Unfortunately the mechanisms that regulate neuronal apoptosis are complex. However, it is this very complexity that provides us with a wide array of potential targets for the development of anti-apoptotic strategies. Thus, our lab is currently exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for neuronal apoptosis, with a particular focus on the role of the metals copper, zinc, and iron. Each of these metals is essential for normal central nervous system (CNS) development and function. However, imbalances, either excess or deficiency, can result in neuronal apoptosis.

Mutations in a gene encoding a ubiquitous antioxidant enzyme, Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), have been first identified as a cause of familial forms of ALS. It is widely accepted that mutant SOD1 proteins cause the disease through a gain in toxicity but not through a loss of its physiological function. SOD1 is a major copper-binding protein and regulates copper homeostasis in the cell; therefore, a toxicity of mutant SOD1 could arise from the disruption of copper homeostasis. In this review, we will briefly review recent studies implying roles of copper homeostasis in the pathogenesis of SOD1-ALS and highlight the therapeutic interventions focusing on pharmacological as well as genetic regulations of copper homeostasis to modify the pathological process in SOD1-ALS.",2016,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
28144156,Update on the clinical management of Wilson's disease.,Peter Hedera,"Wilson's disease (WD), albeit relatively rare, is an important genetic metabolic disease because of highly effective therapies that can be lifesaving. It is a great imitator and requires a high index of suspicion for correct and timely diagnosis. Neurologic, psychiatric and hepatologic problems in WD are very nonspecific, and we discuss the most common clinical phenotypes. The diagnosis remains laboratory based, and here we review the most important challenges and pitfalls in laboratory evaluation of WD, including the emerging role of genetic testing in WD diagnosis. WD is a monogenic disorder but has very high allelic heterogeneity with >500 disease-causing mutations identified, and new insights into phenotype-genotype correlations are also reviewed. The gold standard of therapy is chelation of excessive copper, but many unmet needs exist because of possible clinical deterioration in treated patients and potential adverse effects associated with currently available chelating medications. We also review the most promising novel therapeutic approaches, including chelators targeting specific cell types, cell transplantation and gene therapy.",2017,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

First, bench-top μXRF was utilized for a coarse scan of the sample under laboratory conditions. The resulting distribution maps of copper and iron enabled the determination of a region of interest (ROI) for further analysis. In order to obtain more detailed elemental information, this ROI was analyzed by synchrotron radiation (SR)-based μXRF with a beam size of 4 μm offering a resolution at the cellular level. Distribution maps of additional elements to copper and iron like zinc and manganese were obtained due to a higher sensitivity of SR-μXRF. In addition to this, X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) was performed to identify the oxidation states of copper in WD. This speciation analysis indicated a mixture of copper(i) and copper(ii) within the WD liver tissue.",2016,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The commonly used drug d-penicillamine (PA) or trientine both cause a high incidence (10-50%) of neurological worsening, which rarely occurs with tetrathiomolybdate (TM) treatment. To investigate the mechanisms of neurologic deterioration after the initiation of chelation therapy, brain hydroxyl radical and free copper were assessed in vivo in this study. On days 3, 7, 14, and 21 after PA or TM administration, striatal hydroxyl radical levels of both TX mice and controls were assessed by terephthalic acid (TA) combined with microdialysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Within the same microdialysis samples, free copper was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that both hydroxyl radical and free copper markedly increased in the striatum of TX mice during PA administration but were not elevated when administering TM. These results suggested that the further increased free copper in the brain and oxidative stress caused by some chelators might contribute to the neurological deterioration.",2015,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
26031236,Wilson's disease caused by alternative splicing and Alu exonization due to a homozygous 3039-bp deletion spanning from intron 1 to exon 2 of the ATP7B gene.,"Eva Mameli, Maria Barbara Lepori, Francesca Chiappe, Giusy Ranucci, Fabiola Di Dato, Raffaele Iorio, Georgios Loudianos","We describe a case of Wilson's disease (WD) diagnosed at 5 years after routine biochemical test showed increased aminotransferases. Mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene revealed a 3039-bp deletion in the homozygous state spanning from the terminal part of intron 1 to nt position 368 of exon 2. This deletion results in the activation of 3 cryptic splice sites: an AG acceptor splice site in nt positions 578-579 producing a different breakpoint and removing the first 577 nts of exon 2, an acceptor and a donor splice site in nt positions 20363-4 and 20456-7, respectively, in intron 1, resulting in the activation of a 94-bp cryptic Alu exon being incorporated into the mature transcript. The resulting alternative transcript contains a TAG stop codon in the first amino acid position of the cryptic exon, likely producing a truncated, non-functional protein. This study shows that intron exonization can also occur in humans through naturally occurring gross deletions. The results suggest that the combination of DNA and RNA analyses can be used for molecular characterization of gross ATP7B deletions, thus improving genetic counseling and diagnosis of WD. Moreover these studies help to better establish new molecular mechanisms producing Wilson's disease.",2015,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Laboratory examinations showed decreased concentrations of serum copper and ceruloplasmin, and increased urinary copper levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high-signal-intensity lesions in the bilateral putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, and brainstem on T2-weighted images (T2WI). Based on the MRI results and laboratory data, we diagnosed this patient with Wilson's disease (WD). He was treated with trientine hydrochloride and zinc acetate. Four months after the initiation of treatment, the patient'symptoms began to improve. On a follow-up MRI that was obtained 6 years after treatment, the high-signal-intensity lesions on the T2WI had disappeared completely. However, the low-signal-intensity lesions in the basal ganglia had spread to the caudate nuclei. Here, we discuss the characteristics of the MRI changes in WD following treatment. The Pathological basis for the low-signal-intensity lesions on T2WI in WD remains unclear.

25995328,Neural plasticity and memory: molecular mechanism.,Zareen Amtul,"Deciphering the cellular and molecular mechanisms of memory has been an important topic encompassing the learning and memory domain besides the neurodegenerative disorders. Synapses accumulate cognitive information from life-lasting alterations of their molecular and structural composition. Current memory storage models identify posttranslational modification imperative for short-term information storage and mRNA translation for long-term information storage. However, the precise account of these modifications has not been summarized at the individual synapse level. Therefore, herein we describe the spatiotemporal reorganization of synaptic plasticity at the dendritic spine level to elucidate the mechanism through which synaptic substructures are remodeled; though at the molecular level, such mechanisms are still quite unclear. It has thus been concluded that the existing mechanisms do not entirely elaborate memory storage processes. Further efforts are therefore encouraged to delineate the mechanism of neuronal connectivity at the chemical level as well, including inter- or intramolecular bonding patterns at the synaptic level, which may be a permissive and vital step of memory storage.",2015,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The age of onset is highly variable but IEMs afflict mostly the pediatric population. However, in the past decades, the advancement in management and new therapeutic approaches have led to the improvement in IEM patient care. As a result, many patients with IEMs are surviving into adulthood and developing their own set of complications. In addition, some IEMs will present in adulthood. It is important for internists to have the knowledge and be familiar with these conditions because it is predicted that more and more adult patients with IEMs will need continuity of care in the near future. The review will focus on Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, citrin deficiency, and HFE-associated hemochromatosis which are typically found in the adult population.

He had no symptoms such as anorexia, poor appetite, and jaundice, had normal growth and development, and showed no hepatosplenomegaly. Laboratory examination revealed significantly reduced ceruloplasmin (35 mg/L), as well as negative hepatotropic virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus. There were normal muscle enzymes, blood glucose, and blood ammonia and negative liver-specific autoantibodies. The boy had negative K-F ring and normal 24-hour urine copper (0.56 μmol/L). The ATP7B gene testing for the boy, his sister, and their parents detected two novel missense mutations in the boy and his sister, i.e., compound heterozygous mutations in exon 7 (c.2075T>C, p.L692P) and exon 13 (c.3044T>C, p.L1015P), which were inherited from their father and mother, respectively. Wilson's disease was confirmed by genetic diagnosis in the boy and his sister. The boy and his sister were given a low-copper diet.

25682188,The protection conferred by chelation therapy in post-MI diabetics might be replicated by high-dose zinc supplementation.,"Mark F McCarty, James J DiNicolantonio","The recent Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) study, enrolling subjects who had previously experienced a myocardial infarction, has provided strong evidence that intravenous chelation therapy can markedly reduce risk for mortality and vascular events in diabetics, whereas no discernible benefit was observed in non-diabetics. It has plausibly been suggested that this reflects a role for transition metal ions--iron or copper--in the genesis of advanced glycation end products, key mediators of diabetic complications that can destabilize plaque. Since phlebotomy therapy fails to prevent vascular events in diabetics, we hypothesize that labile copper may be the chief culprit whose removal by chelation mediated the benefit observed in TACT. If so, strategies less time and labor intensive than chelation therapy might provide comparable benefit. A number of recent studies report that the copper-specific orally-active chelator trientine can reduce risk for range of diabetic complications in rodents; a clinical trial with this agent demonstrated some decrease in left ventricular mass in diabetics with ventricular hypertrophy. However, until this agent becomes less expensive, supplementation with high-dose zinc may represent a more feasible alternative. Zinc opposes the absorption and redox activity of copper via induction of the antioxidant protein metallothionein, which binds copper tightly. A great many studies demonstrate that increased expression of metallothionein decreases risk for tissue damage in diabetic rodents, and in some of these studies metallothionein expression was boosted by supplemental zinc. Zinc supplementation also modestly improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetics, and might reduce risk for diabetes by protecting pancreatic beta cells from oxidative stress. A long term study assessing the impact of supplementing diabetics with high-dose zinc, assessing risk for mortality, vascular events, and diabetic complications, may be warranted. Histidine, which readily forms complexes with copper that possess superoxide dismutase activity, also has potential for alleviating the contribution of loosely bound copper to AGE formation; moreover, in a recent clinical study, supplemental histidine improved insulin sensitivity and exerted anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in women with metabolic syndrome. Since ascorbate can reduce labile copper and thereby enhance its pathogenicity, the impact of high-dose ascorbate supplementation on cardiovascular risk in diabetics should receive further study.",2015,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

3535379,Synergistic neurotoxicity of carbon tetrachloride/carbon disulfide (80/20 fumigants) and other pesticides in grain storage workers.,"H A Peters, R L Levine, C G Matthews, S Sauter, L Chapman","Neurophysiologic, neurobehavioral, and neuropsychologic profiles in 17 grain storage workers, 1 grain inspector, and 4 malting laboratory workers are described. The effects of CS2 toxicity as seen in viscose rayon workers as well as in experimental animals is remarkably similar to the clinical profile of our grain storage workers. CS2 use explains the dysfunction of peripheral axons, auditory nerve, the optic nerve, and the extrapyramidal system, as well as altered behavior and cognition changes. The signs and symptoms in these workers seem to be dose-related and we note that workers separated out from the areas where fumigation took place reported improvement not seen by fellow workers who continued the fumigant treatment routine. Likewise, malting laboratory workers exposed only to the grain dust from 3 to 7 years showed only minimal symptoms. Though a number of mechanism have been suggested for the alteration of neuropsychological function, the chelating ability of DDC derived from CS2 and its ability to markedly increase copper and zinc within the central nervous system suggests a mechanism of toxicity analogous to copper intoxication as in Wilson's Disease and may explain the production of extrapyramidal symptoms in these patients. Chelation of copper might prove therapeutic in CS2 poisoning. It is obvious that both basic and clinical research will be necessary to sort out the questions raised. We applaud the EPA's decision to ban the use of 80/20 fumigants and also methyl bromide, and trust that similar toxic substances be carefully studied before their selection for replacing these previous toxic agents. We further decry the technique of re-introducing grain dust into the food chain rather than destroying it, since the dust contains very high residues of fumigant material. We speculate on the possible role of CS2 and other pesticides in the food chain and the incidence of Parkinsonian symptoms in these patients and the general public.",1986,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
3514056,Genetic diseases of copper metabolism.,J R Prohaska,"There are several known examples of mutations which influence copper homeostasis in humans and animals. Pleiotropic effects are observed when the mutant gene disturbs copper flux. In some cases, the mutation alters the level of a specific copper ligand (enzyme) and the clinical consequences are unique. The two most widely studied genetic maladies in humans are Menkes' and Wilson's diseases. Menkes' disease is an X-linked fatal disorder in which copper accumulates in some organs (intestine and kidney) and is low in others (liver and brain). Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which copper accumulates, if untreated, in liver and subsequently in brain and kidney. Pathophysiological consequences of copper deficiency and toxicity characterize these two disorders. Specific mutations of human cuproenzymes include overproduction of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase in Down's syndrome, absence of tyrosinase in albinism, hereditary mitochondrial myopathy due to reduction in cytochrome c oxidase, and altered lysyl oxidase in X-linked forms of cutis laxa and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Mutations altering copper metabolism are also known in animals. Several murine mutants have been studied. The most extensively investigated mutants are the mottled mice, in particular brindled mice, which have a mutation analogous to that of Menkes' disease. Another recently described murine mutation is toxic milk (tx) an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by copper accumulation in liver. Two other mutants, crinkled and quaking, were once thought to exhibit abnormal copper metabolism. Recent data has not confirmed this. A mutation in Bedlington terriers has been described which is very similar to Wilson's disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1986,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The diagnosis was confirmed by hepatic nonspecific changes, high copper urine excretion, and low to zero serum ceruloplasmin, but psychiatric symptomatology was the main manifestation of the disease. The history of treatment modalities and a controlled trial with penicillamine revealed a clear priority of this drug over phenothiazines in abolishing the psychotic features of the disease. The effective dose in this case was found to be over 1650 mg/day. The mental state, as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, was clearly correlated to the dose of penicillamine. In addition, there was a tendency to increased copper excretion with penicillamine treatment.

Menkes' disease (classical and mild variant forms) and X linked Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IX, X linked cutis laxa) have features in common with one another and with the brindled (Mobr) and blotchy (Moblo) mouse mutants, respectively. There may be one allelic series of mutants in each species or two loci may be involved in each. The toxic milk mutant (tx) in the mouse may be homologous to Wilson's disease in man. The defect of intestinal absorption of zinc in acrodermatitis enteropathica has no homologue yet in the mouse. However, the lethal milk (lm) mutant in the mouse may be homologous to a condition of zinc deficiency described in a few breastfed, low birth weight infants.

In an attempt to develop a simpler and faster tool for evaluating the adequacy of zinc therapy, a technique that measures the uptake into blood of a small oral dose of 64copper was studied in conjunction with copper balance. The mean peak 64copper uptake into blood of nine Wilson's disease patients on D-penicillamine, trien, or no medication was 6.04 +/- 2.74%, comparable with normal controls. Seven patients on zinc therapy had a markedly and significantly reduced mean uptake of 0.79 +/- 1.05% after treatment. The data demonstrate that the prevention of copper uptake into blood in Wilson's disease patients by zinc therapy can be evaluated by 64copper uptake and that peak uptakes of less than 1% occur in patients with neutral or negative copper balance.",1986,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Copper contents, which were determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the liver, kidney, and cerebral tissues from the patient, were 28-, 38-, and 3.5-fold, respectively, as compared to those of control subject, who was 5-year-old girl and died of cerebral palsy. Each tissue was homogenized in 3 volumes of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 105,000 g for 60 min to obtain cytosol fraction. Sephadex G-75 gel chromatography of cytosols from Wilson's liver and kidney showed that most of increased copper existed as Cu-thionein (Cu-Th), in contrast to a much lower Cu-Th level in control liver cytosol and to no detectable amount of Cu-Th in control kidney cytosol. In addition, Zn-Th was also increased in Wilson's kidney cytosol, while it was decreased in Wilson's liver cytosol. Gel chromatography of Wilson's cerebral cytosol revealed that the increased copper bound mainly to two proteins with apparent molecular mass of 10 kDa (Cu-BP 1) and 20 kDa (Cu-BP 2), respectively, both of which showed no absorption at 280 nm and were not observed in control cerebral cytosol even after addition of excess copper (50 micrograms/ml) as CuSO4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1986,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

6361779,Biological roles of ionic zinc.,"G J Brewer, G M Hill, A S Prasad, Z T Cossack","We tentatively conclude from our work that intracellular calcium acts as a second messenger to affect membrane function through activation of calmodulin. This activation, if too great, leads to pathological erythrocyte adherence and aggregation phenomena. We have shown that calmodulin inhibitors can prevent some of these calcium-induced abnormalities. Since some of this work involves a very specific anticalmodulin antibody, it appears very likely that calmodulin is involved in producing membrane effects. Zinc appears to act upon the membrane in part, at least, through the inhibition of calmodulin action. Our work leads us to believe that zinc regulates copper absorption from the gastrointestinal tract in a somewhat complex manner. That is, direct zinc-copper antagonism within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is not adequate to explain the effects of zinc on inhibiting copper absorption in man. It appears from our work that tissues must become loaded with zinc before an effect on copper absorption is observed. This produces a lag effect during which zinc administration does not produce a negative copper balance. However, after this lag effect, zinc has produced a negative to neutral copper balance in 5 of 5 Wilson's disease patients studied. At this time, therefore, we believe that zinc therapy can be offered as an alternative to penicillamine therapy in previously decoppered patients or patients who are not yet symptomatic.

To define the extent of myocardial degeneration in newly diagnosed or chronically treated Wilson's disease, we reviewed the autopsy findings in 9 cases with this condition. We compared our observations with those in 3 control cases, selected for comparable age and with liver disease having no known association with cardiac degeneration. Our results revealed cardiac hypertrophy in 5 out of 9 cases of Wilson's disease. There was evidence of interstitial and replacement fibrosis, intramyocardial small vessel sclerosis and focal inflammatory cell inflammation to a variable degree in all cases. One case had AV nodal degeneration, and a 15 year old boy had severe atherosclerosis of the left main coronary artery. Two patients died suddenly, presumably secondary to an arrhythmia; one of these patients had the most marked myocardial alterations. We could not correlate these changes specifically with the tissue levels of copper, treatment with D-penicillamine, or the presence of cirrhosis. We conclude that there are definite morphological abnormalities in the hearts of patients with Wilson's disease consistent with a cardiomyopathy. Though the myocardial changes were non-specific, the fact that 2 patients died suddenly, suggests the need for a prospective study of cardiac function in these patients in the future.",1982,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

7082716,"Zinc, the brain and behavior.","C C Pfeiffer, E R Braverman","The total content of zinc in the adult human body averages almost 2 g. This is approximately half the total iron content and 10 to 15 times the total body copper. In the brain, zinc is with iron, the most concentrated metal. The highest levels of zinc are found in the hippocampus in synaptic vesicles, boutons, and mossy fibers. Zinc is also found in large concentrations in the choroid layer of the retina which is an extension of the brain. Zinc plays an important role in axonal and synaptic transmission and is necessary for nucleic acid metabolism and brain tubulin growth and phosphorylation. Lack of zinc has been implicated in impaired DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis during brain development. For these reasons, deficiency of zinc during pregnancy and lactation has been shown to be related to many congenital abnormalities of the nervous system in offspring. Furthermore, in children insufficient levels of zinc have been associated with lowered learning ability, apathy, lethargy, and mental retardation. Hyperactive children may be deficient in zinc and vitamin B-6 and have an excess of lead and copper. Alcoholism, schizophrenia, Wilson's disease, and Pick's disease are brain disorders dynamically related to zinc levels. Zinc has been employed with success to treat Wilson's disease, achrodermatitis enteropathica, and specific types of schizophrenia.",1982,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

There is an excess urinary output of free amino acids and of urinary peptides in most cases of untreated Wilson's disease. Studies of 11 patients have shown that both these abnormalities are greatly improved by two years of standard chelation therapy. 2. The reduction in excretion of both free amino acids and peptides is purely quantitative, there being no significant change in the percentage composition of amino acids, either free or combined, in relation to their total urinary output. 3. Arguments are advanced that the peptiduria of the disease is usually due to a proximal renal tubular reabsorption defect, but in rare cases it may be due to excess bone breakdown or even to a combination of bone and renal tubular disease in the same patient.",1983,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The causes of zinc deficiency include malnutrition, alcoholism, malabsorption, extensive burns, chronic debilitating disorders, chronic renal disease, certain diuretics, the use of chelating agents such as penicillamine for Wilson's disease, and genetic disorders such as acrodermatitis enteropathica and sickle cell disease. The requirement of zinc is increased in pregnancy and during the growing age period. The clinical manifestations in severe cases of zinc deficiency included bullous-pustular dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhoea, emotional disorder, weight loss, intercurrent infections, hypogonadism in males and it is fatal if untreated. A moderate deficiency of zinc is characterized by growth retardation and delayed puberty in adolescents, hypogonadism in males, rough skin, poor appetite, mental lethargy, delayed wound healing, taste abnormalities and abnormal dark adaptation. In mild cases of zinc deficiency in human subjects, we have observed oligospermia, slight weight loss and hyperammonaemia. Zinc is a growth factor. As a result of its deficiency, growth is affected adversely in many animal species and in man. Inasmuch as zinc is needed for protein and DNA synthesis and cell division, it is believed that the growth effect of zinc is related to its effect on protein synthesis. Testicular functions are affected adversely as a result of zinc deficiency in both humans and experimental animals. This effect of zinc is at the end organ level and the hypothalamic--pituitary axis is intact in zinc-deficient subjects. Inasmuch as zinc is intimately involved in a cell division, its deficiency may adversely affect testicular size and thus its function. In mice, the incidence of degenerate oocytes, and hypohaploidy and hyperhaploidy in metaphase II oocytes were increased due to zinc deficiency. Zinc at physiological concentrations reduced prolactin secretion from the pituitary in vitro and it has been suggested that this trace element may have a role in the in vivo regulation of prolactin release. Thymopoietin, a hormone needed for T-cell maturation, has also been shown to be zinc dependent. It is clear that zinc may have several roles in biochemical and hormonal functions of various endocrine organs. Future research in this area is very much needed.",1985,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The case reported is an example. The DPA- induced myasthenia gravis (MG) is similar to the spontaneous MG clinically and electrophysiologically, though ocular signs prevail in the former. Antibodies to acetylcholine receptor have been demonstrated and thymic hyperplasia also has been formed. Regarding the onset of myasthenic manifestations the duration of the treatment with DPA varies from 6 to 10 months. The action of DPA on the neuromuscular junction is different from that occurring in spontaneous MG. The pathogenesis of the DPA induced MG is still obscure. The chemical properties of DPA permit it to react with many proteins and some alteration of proteins may appear, with structural changes in the composition and antigenicity of the collagen fibers. In vitro DPA causes disorder of acetylcholine receptor bridges to alpha, beta, gamma sub-units with reduction of the S-S bridges in the gamma-subunit. This decreases the linkage of high affinity and abolishes its positive cooperative system, reducing the S-S connection in the alpha-unit near the acetylcholine linkage. The interaction between DPA and receptor may induce antigenic alteration in this latter, starting the autoimmune phenomena. The other possibility is the stimulation of prostaglandin E-1 synthesis by DPA may fill the allosteric place of ACh receptor, interfering on the neuromuscular junction.",1984,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

This procedure involved the preparation of apo-MT and its reconstitution to holo-MT with Zn or Cd. Three predominant isoforms of MT were present in all specimens.

The thiomolybdate assay is capable of reliably detecting 14 ng MT and thus is particularly suitable for measuring MT in small tissue samples (e.g., biopsies), in extrahepatic tissues, and in cultured cells. Moreover, the combination of the thiomolybdate assay with the recently developed Cd-Chelex assay also makes it possible to determine the portion of MT which binds Cu (Cu load of MT), provided that the amount of non-Cu-thionein exceeds 100 ng, the detection limit of the Cd-Chelex assay.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

It is excellent for maintenance therapy and for the treatment of the presymptomatic patient. Current evidence suggests that it will also be excellent for the treatment of the pregnant patient. Zinc acts by inducing intestinal cell metallothionein, which binds copper with high affinity, blocking its absorption, and causing its excretion in the stool. We have shown that zinc, even in doses as low as 25 mg daily, negatively affects copper balance. Zinc in doses of 50 mg three times daily, with all doses separated from food, controls the abnormal positive copper balance, blocks uptake of orally administered 64Cu, controls urine and plasma copper, prevents the reaccumulation of hepatic copper, and prevents the development or progression of symptoms of copper toxicosis in Wilson's disease patients. Zinc acetate will probably be licensed in the near future for the treatment of Wilson's disease. We recommend that physicians use urine and plasma copper, and urine zinc, as primary monitoring tools. In contrast to the comfortable situation with maintenance therapy, the initial treatment of acutely ill Wilson's disease patients is not well worked out. Patients with neurological disease often get worse initially on penicillamine, and zinc acts more slowly than is ideal. We have initiated studies of tetrathiomolybdate for this purpose. Studies of biliary secretions of normal subjects suggest that they excrete regulatory (excess) copper packaged in a protease-resistant ceruloplasmin fragment. This fragment is missing in Wilson's disease bile.

2129813,Liver copper concentration in Wilson's disease: effect of treatment with 'anti-copper' agents.,"K Gibbs, J M Walshe","Serial copper determinations have been made on the livers of 10 patients with Wilson's disease. Two were studied before and eight after the start of treatment in order to assess the effect, if any, on the concentration of the metal. In two patients who were receiving no therapy and in one in whom it had been discontinued, the level of copper rose. In the latter patient, resumption of treatment then resulted in a fall in the level of copper in the liver. A similar fall was seen in seven patients on continuous therapy. In one patient, a very poor complier, there was a tendency for the liver copper concentration to rise over a 5-year period. All three therapies investigated--penicillamine, trientine and tetrathiomolybdate--when taken regularly, appear to be effective in reducing liver copper levels. Sixty-nine single determinations of liver copper have been plotted against time on treatment. This shows that the copper concentration falls rapidly in the first year. Thereafter, there is no linear relationship between the duration of treatment and liver copper. Poor compliers have a higher liver copper concentration than do good compliers. Determinations made from different portions of the liver showed that in only one of 19 examples was there an overlap between the near normal and the abnormal range. The principal mechanism of action of 'anti-copper' agents in Wilson's disease appears to be the mobilization of copper from the tissues, but a secondary detoxifying action may come into play later.",1990,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
2095555,[Prenatal diagnosis: a chance? risk? dilemma?].,B Czartoryska,"In research on congenital metabolic disorders, a biochemist can choose between the theoretical and the practical approach. The diagnosis of metabolic diseases relies on 1) the determination of the presence of metabolites under normal conditions that are direct substrates of the defective enzyme (e.g., the Gm2 ganglioside in the brain tissue of a patient with Tay-Sachs disease); 2) the determination of the lack or insufficiency of the direct product of the defective enzyme (e.g., aryl sulfatase A in the cells of patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy), hormone (hypothyroidism), or receptor (congenital hypercholesterolemia); 3) determination of substance whose reduction was established by experimentation, but the cause of the decrease is not known (ceruloplasmin in Wilson's disease); and 4) DNA analysis. Metabolic impairment of genetic origin is not treatable. The disease can be prevented by 1) removing the inappropriate metabolite (e.g., copper accumulation can be avoided by giving penicillamine or zinc salts); 2) limiting those substances in the critical phase of childhood that are components of the defective enzyme (e.g. gluten reduction in colic and protein in phenylketonuria); 3) supplementing the insufficient metabolite (e.g., phosphate in hypophosphatemia by sound for 12 hours a day); 4) protecting the patients (e.g. from light in porphyria); and 5) treatment by substances (giving coagulation factor VIII in hemophilia and thyroid hormones in hypothyroidism). There is a dilemma in subjecting patients to a diagnosis of progression to Huntington's chorea 20 years in advance or informing them about the high risk of hereditary disease for the next child (25% for the recessive and 50% for the dominant mode).

2036736,Assessment of portal hypertension: understanding will improve treatment.,D J van Leeuwen,"To many people it may be disappointing that many uncertainties remain with respect to the assessment of PHT. Only a few findings such as increased WHVPG and varices prove PHT. However, we have gained considerable knowledge. PHT is the consequence of a number of changes which involve the intrahepatic and extrahepatic circulation. Alcohol, viruses and drugs may disturb parenchymal architecture and cause cellular swelling, collagen and fibrin deposition and invasion with inflammatory cells. These processes finally may evolve into cirrhosis. Although in initial stages the parenchymal disturbance per se may account for PHT, increasingly impaired liver function results in metabolic changes which cause altered haemodynamics. Advanced PHT in parenchymal liver disease is the result of the complex interaction between local and systemic changes. The current techniques for the assessment of PHT are helpful for the qualitative aspects: increase in pressure can be assessed directly or indirectly; the portal venous system can be visualized even without arteriography. Gastroscopy remains a standard procedure for diagnosing PHT. Ultrasound-endoscopy is particularly helpful to confirm fundic varices and to assess changes after sclerotherapy. Increasingly, non-invasive methods to quantify PHT have become available such as the Duplex scanner. However, limitations and pitfalls need to be realized. The quantitative assessment remains (as yet?) a technique for research centres. It is obvious that the clinician in general practice can do without most of the more sophisticated techniques which have been discussed here. For the time being, PHT, and particularly variceal bleeding, is most often treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy. For that reason, only in a minority of the cases very detailed studies are required. However, the increasing knowledge opens new perspectives for the treatment and prevention of PHT on various levels. This may be a rather specific treatment of parenchymal liver disease (antivirals, d-penicillamine for Wilson's disease or venesections for haemochromatosis), drugs which may reduce local tissue damage via more general pathways (colchicine, steroids) and drugs which influence flow. Undoubtedly one of these years a more selective blocker of portal venous pressure will become available. Optimal assessment for that type of therapy makes it mandatory to master at least a few more advanced techniques. With respect to noncirrhotic PHT with causes which may vary from congenital or acquired clotting abnormalities to anatomical malformations (oesophageal web) and 'natural healthy herb tea', measures can be taken. It is clear that before treating any of the more rare causes, a proper diagnostic work-up is required.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",1991,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
1993498,Prognosis of Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis.,"M L Schilsky, I H Scheinberg, I Sternlieb","Twenty of 320 patients with Wilson's disease initially presented with chemical and laboratory features of chronic active hepatitis, confirmed histologically in 17. When first seen, cirrhosis was present in all 20 and was complicated by ascites and/or jaundice in 11. Within 1 week to 8 years of the onset of over liver disease the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established, and treatment with D-penicillamine was promptly initiated in 19 patients. One man refused treatment and died 4 months later. Treated patients received D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median, 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention, for which salt restriction and diuretics were added to penicillamine or trientine, disappeared in all but 1 of the patients so affected. Symptomatic improvement and virtually normal levels of serum albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase followed within 1 year in the majority of subjects. One woman died after 9 months of treatment. Two patients, who became noncompliant with the therapeutic regimen after 9 and 17 years of successful pharmacological treatment, required liver transplants. These results indicate that the prognosis of specifically treated Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis is very good in spite of the presence of cirrhosis.",1991,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Other available anticopper drug therapies do not appear to offer a solution to this treatment problem. We are developing and evaluating a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for this purpose. Theoretically, tetrathiomolybdate has optimal properties, including an immediate blockade of copper absorption and the property of forming complexes with copper in the blood, rendering the copper nontoxic. In this article, we present results from six patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate for up to 8 weeks as initial therapy.

IX: Response of serum lipids.,"G J Brewer, V Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, V Johnson","Zinc therapy in Wilson's disease is a lifelong treatment to prevent reaccumulation of copper. Previous reports have shown that in normal male subjects, zinc ingestion has reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. This finding raises the possibility that lifelong zinc therapy could be atherogenic. In the present work, the effects of zinc therapy on serum lipids over a period of years is evaluated in patients with Wilson's disease. Zinc therapy reduces total cholesterol level by about 10% in both sexes and reduces high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by about 20% in male patients. The mechanisms of these interesting effects of zinc on cholesterol metabolism are unknown. The coronary heart disease risk factor is not changed significantly by zinc therapy in either sex, and further, it remains below average in these patients after zinc therapy. We conclude that zinc therapy in Wilson's disease is not atherogenic.",1991,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Before the treatment, urinary copper excretion (UCE) was 70-96 micrograms/day. UCE increased to 1,512-2,352 micrograms/day on the day of initial administration, and remained at levels between 350-1,100 micrograms/day, thereafter. During 2 months of trien therapy, neurological deficits regressed in three patients, and only slightly in one patient. No adverse effects were observed. These results and the retrospective survey on 17 patients treated with D-PC confirmed that trien is less potent but a safer copper chelating agent than D-PC. The transient aggravation of neurological deficits seen in two patients during the early stage of the treatment suggested that trien, as D-PC, should be started in small doses and gradually increased.",1991,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

1794220,Pathophysiology and treatment of Wilson's disease.,R M Tankanow,"The pathophysiology, symptomatology, and treatment of Wilson's disease are reviewed, and new approaches to drug management are discussed. Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder that occurs between the ages of 6 and 60 years. Disturbances in copper metabolism may result in the accumulation of excess copper in the liver, the basal ganglia of the brain (lenticular degeneration), the kidneys, the cornea (Kayser-Fleischer rings), and other tissues. The diagnosis of Wilson's disease is frequently overlooked; nonspecific symptoms and multisystem involvement may mimic other disease states, such as neurologic and psychiatric disorders, and hemolytic anemia. Screening tests for Wilson's disease include 24-hour urinary copper levels, serum ceruloplasmin and copper assays, radioactive uptake of 64Cu, and liver biopsy. Current methods of therapy include the use of a chelating agent--penicillamine or trientine--for initial rapid decoppering. Penicillamine therapy has been associated with many adverse reactions, including worsening of the neurologic symptoms of the patient. Zinc is a useful agent for maintenance therapy. Investigational studies exploring the use of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for initial rapid decoppering have shown promising results. Unless it is recognized and treated, Wilson's disease can cause severe symptoms and, ultimately, death. Initial rapid decoppering with chelating agents, such as penicillamine and trientine, followed by lifelong maintenance therapy with zinc is the current method of treatment.",1991,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The levels of metallothionein (MT), Cu, and zinc (Zn) in the livers of two Wilson's disease patients were analyzed in this study. About 50-fold increase in the Cu levels above normal controls was observed in both patients (160 and 298 micrograms/g of wet tissue). About 73% of subcellular Cu was present in the cytoplasmic fraction and most of it was in association with MT. Analysis of hepatic MT levels showed a 3-fold increase (863 micrograms/g of wet tissue) over control human levels (321 micrograms/g of wet tissue). The two forms of MT (MT-I and MT-II) were isolated from one liver sample. Both forms contained high amounts of Cu (11 to 12 g atoms/mole), indicating saturation of MT which had only 2 to 3 g atoms of zinc. The distribution of MT in the hepatocytes was investigated using an immunohistochemical method. In tissue sections with minimal tissue damage, there was intense cytoplasmic staining for MT in hepatocytes whereas both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was found in tissue sections with extensive necrosis and fibrosis. These results suggest that MT is the major hepatic Cu-binding protein in Wilson's disease, that it is present in a form saturated with Cu, and that only in degenerating hepatocytes is it found in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm.",1987,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

CSF copper was found to be elevated in all cases, especially in the four examined before therapy. Two patients were followed up for a period of 3 years, while undergoing therapy with chelating substances. In case 1, the data and the clinical course are presented in detail: prior to therapy, the daily urinary copper excretion had been elevated, and this increased during the initial treatment stages. The serum copper concentration, which was already low, decreased quickly the during the initial stages of therapy, and remained at a low level during further treatment. In contrast to its level in serum, the copper level in the CSF was up to 3-fold the normal range and fell only very slowly as clinical symptoms improved.

No patient demonstrated hepatic reaccumulation of copper during zinc therapy. Copper balance, 24-hour urinary copper excretion, and nonceruloplasmin plasma copper concentration all indicated good copper control during zinc therapy. Hepatic zinc concentration increased twofold to threefold over baseline values but no toxicity was seen. Hepatic zinc concentrations appeared to reach a plateau after 12 to 18 months of zinc therapy.

One patient survived with chronic progressive liver damage for 20 years; diagnosis was also made at post-mortem examination. Mean age at death was 15 years. The diagnosis was made retrospectively in 13 patients who died. In two of these the diagnosis was confirmed by determination of the liver copper concentration on tissue saved at postmortem examination; in the other 11 the diagnosis is probable since other siblings developed a similar illness, proven to be Wilson's disease.

Values for liver-derived serum enzymes were also generally reduced in patients who had pretreatment elevations. Percutaneous liver biopsies were done initially and repeated in seven of the patients after 12 to 35 months of zinc therapy. In five of these patients a second biopsy specimen showed higher levels of copper than the first. In three of these five a third biopsy 6 to 23 months after the second revealed liver copper values that either had returned to the baseline value or were lower. One patient's initial biopsy specimen showed active inflammation, which subsided with therapy. All of the biopsies revealed histologic scarring typical of cirrhosis, and this did not appear to change over the course of therapy. We conclude that hepatic copper may increase temporarily during early zinc therapy but that the accumulated copper is sequestered in a nontoxic form. On the basis of animal studies we postulate that this sequestered copper is primarily bound to the high levels of hepatic metallothionein induced by zinc. Zinc appears to be a reasonable option for the initial treatment of patients with Wilson's disease, particularly those with presymptomatic disease.",1989,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Report of a case and review of the literature.,"E E Sahn, J C Maize, P D Garen, S C Mullins, R M Silver","Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a rare complication of D-penicillamine therapy. It has been reported to occur in Wilson's disease and cystinuria, usually after many years of high-dose therapy. We report a case of D-penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa with unique clinical features occurring in a 10-year-old child with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who received only 71 gm of the drug over 9 months. The case is also unusual because of the short course and low cumulative dose of drug received and because of the calcification of elastic fibers. The calcification of elastic fibers suggests that this case may represent an unusual variant of elastosis perforans serpiginosa or an overlap with pseudoxanthoma elasticum. All reported cases of D-penicillamine-induced elastosis perforans serpiginosa are reviewed, and histopathologic and electron microscopic findings are presented. The theoretic mechanisms of action of D-penicillamine on elastic tissue synthesis and morphology are discussed.",1989,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Changes in serum levels of lipase, amylase, and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease.","V Yuzbasiyan-Gurkan, G J Brewer, G D Abrams, B Main, D Giacherio","We noted a frequent increase in the serum enzymes amylase, lipase, and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilson's disease who are receiving zinc acetate therapy (25 or 50 mg elemental zinc three times daily). Typically, values are normal before the initiation of zinc therapy, increase to slightly above normal after a few weeks of therapy, and stabilize at the high normal range after approximately a year of treatment. Very large dosages of zinc (800 mg/day) produce even further elevation of serum lipase and amylase without the symptoms of pancreatitis. Pancreatic pathologic studies of a zinc-treated rat model receiving dosages equivalent to up to 25 times the effective dosage in a human being, which is based on milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight, reveal that no lesions are induced by zinc treatment in the pancreas. We interpret these findings to indicate that extended maintenance therapy with zinc does not pose a risk of pancreatic damage in patients with Wilson's disease.",1989,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Ceruloplasmin concentrations in the CSF of all patients were almost the same but were lower than those of the controls. CSF copper concentrations in patients without neurologic signs were within the normal range, 22 +/- 6 ng/ml. In contrast, CSF copper concentrations in patients with neurologic signs (69-98 ng/ml) were significantly higher than the normal levels before and at the beginning of the treatment with D-penicillamine; it gradually decreased in response to treatment. These results suggest that the appearance of neurologic manifestations in Wilson disease is not related to the CSF ceruloplasmin concentration. The CSF copper concentration in this disease appears to reflect copper accumulation in the brain and may be useful as a marker for monitoring therapy.",1988,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

In the course of penicillamine therapy the copper content in the liver decreases, but normal values are achieved only after five or more years of treatment. Normalisation of the hepatic cooper concentration lags distinctly behind the clinical state. Distinct improvement of clinical state is already reached after a half to one year of treatment. The correlation between hepatic copper concentration and the amount of copper's excreted in the urine is statistically significant before the starting of treatment and during administration of penicillamine as well.

It was more effective than 2,2,2-tetramine (trien) or D-penicillamine and, in addition, induced a more prolonged cupruresis. Despite their higher formation constants for copper, the macrocyclic tetramines did not induce a significant cupruresis. In this study, the 2,3,2-tetramine was the most effective agent for inducing a cupruresis in both normal and copper-loaded rats. If well tolerated by humans, it could become a useful agent for management of disorders characterized by copper accumulation.",1980,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Chromatographic and uv/vis and electron spin resonance (esr) spectroscopic methods were used. The major species formed, at neutral pH and 0.15 mol dm-3 NaCl, is the violet species which is shown to have the same stoichiometry as the recently reported solid-state complex, i.e., [Cu8I Cu6II (Pen)12 Cl] 5-. The rate of formation of this species (MVC) is shown to be dependent on the Cu concentration, Cu:Pen ratio, relative Cl- ion concentration, pH, and temperature. Formation is inhibited by the presence of O2 and biological chelates. At the concentration levels found in blood plasma it is unlikely that the MVC ion has any significance in the therapeutic action of penicillamine in the treatment of Wilson's disease. Reexamination of the aqueous Cu-albumin-pen system reinforces earlier findings that pen is unable to mobilize Cu that is bound to albumin. Significant binding of pen to the protein is observed is not related to any protein-bound copper ions. Evidence that ternary complexes of the type amino acid-Cu-Pen can form in blood plasma is presented. These are unlikely, however, to be physiologically significant and the copper depletion induced by Pen in Wilson's disease cases must be elsewhere than in the blood plasma compartment.",1979,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The findings are described and analysed with particular reference to their value, both diagnostic and prognostic, in the management of this disease. The commonest abnormalities were ventricular dilation, 73 per cent; cortical atrophy, 63 per cent; brain-stem atrophy, 55 per cent. Characteristic hypodense areas in the regions of the basal ganglia were present in 45 per cent and almost invariably these were accompanied by one or more of the other CT abnormalities. This combination of findings is considered specific for Wilson's disease in the appropriate clinical context. CT abnormalities were most common and most marked in patients with a neurological presentation, only 2 out of 40 having a normal scan. Similar changes were also demonstrated in three-quarters of the patients with an hepatic presentation and nearly half of those who were presymptomatic. Nineteen patients were scanned on more than one occasion to assess the influence of treatment with penicillamine or triethylene tetramine on the abnormalities recorded initially. Fourteen showed basal ganglia hypodensities on first scanning and in ten of these there was a moderate to marked improvement in this abnormality in response to therapy. Corresponding with this there was considerable clinical improvement. Despite the findings of quite severe CT abnormalities in patients with Wilson's disease. suggesting considerable loss of neurons, patients will still respond well to treatment.

By analogy with Wilson's disease, it has been suggested that copper retention is hepatotoxic in PBC, and this has been the rationale for the use of D-penicillamine in this disease. The hypothesis that copper is hepatotoxic in PBC has not been tested and in this study we have evaluated the role of liver copper retention in the pathogenesis of PBC. Sixty-four patients with PBC have been studied. Fifty-four had increased liver copper concentrations. Liver cell synthetic function was well preserved. All the patients had normal prothrombin times, and only two had subnormal serum albumin concentrations. There was no correlation between liver copper concentrations and the degree of liver cell damage assessed biochemically (aspartate transaminase), and histologically. Electron microscopy was performed on liver biopsies from five patients with markedly increased liver copper concentrations. The liver cell ultrastructure was compatible with cholestasis. Liver cells contained electron dense lysosomes, which were shown to contain copper and sulphur by x-ray probe microanalysis. The characteristic organelle changes associated with copper toxicity in Wilson's disease were not observed. The biochemical, histological, and histochemical differences between PBC complicated by liver copper retention, and Wilson's disease, indicates that there are differences in the handling of copper in these disease. In this study we could find no evidence to suggest that copper plays an important role in the pathogenesis of liver dysfunction in PBC.",1981,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The involvement of copper toxicity in the progression of PBC is supported by the observation that the highest values occur in association with the hepatic failure that occurs in the advanced stage.Corticosteroid therapy appears to decrease hepatic copper levels in PBC. Although this therapy does not invariably lower the hepatic Cu content in patients with PBC, it does so in many individuals. Therapeutic trials with d-penicillamine are in progress.

Their relationships with the endoplasmic reticulum observed in other species and in other organs were also demonstrable in this material. Some normal peroxisomes were found to display marginal plates or peripheral crystalline inclusions which were present in pathologic specimens as well. In certain inherited metabolic disorders (Menkes' steely hair disease, analbuminemia) the volume of the individual peroxisomes appeared to be considerably reduced. But most pathologic processes affecting hepatocytes seem to produce any or several of the following: increased volume or numbers per cell, changes of shapes, alterations of the consistency of the matrix, appearance of dense numbers per cell, changes of shapes, alterations of the consistency of the matrix, appearance of dense inclusions, or clustering of peroxisomes in some portions of the cytoplasm. Some of these abnormalities are reversible based on observations in three patients with Wilson's disease treated with D-penicillamine. The mean +/- standard deviation of diameters of peroxisomes in four normal subjects was 0.618 +/- 0.143 mum. Significant reductions or increases in mean diameters of peroxisomes were noted in all but two of the 16 pathologic specimens. There were other morphologic abnormalities present in the remaining two specimens. We conclude that various pathologic processes involving the hepatocytic cytoplasm exert different effects on peroxisomes.

1023089,Wilson's disease (hepatolenticular degeneration).,B E Herron,"Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism which usually affects young people. Excess copper accumulates in the tissues, primarily in the liver, brain, and cornea. This copper deposition results in a wide range of hepatic and neurological symptoms, and may produce psychiatric illness. Hepatic involvement often occurs in childhood, while neurological deficits generally are detected at a later age. The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Ocular findings are of particular importance because the corneal copper deposition, forming the Kayser-Fleischer ring,is the only pathognomonic sign of the disease. The structure of the ring and the presence of copper have been well established. An anterior capsular deposition of copper in the lens results in a characteristic sunflower cataract in some of these patients. Other ocular abnormalities have been described but are much less common. The pathogenesis of the disease and the basic genetic defect remain obscure. It is clear that there is excess copper in the tissues, but the mechanism of its deposition is unknown. It is in some way associated with a failure to synthesize the serum copper protein ceruloplasmin normally. Another theory suggests that an abnormal protein with a high affinity for copper may bind the metal in the tissues. The diagnosis may be suggested by the clinical manifestations and confirmed by the presence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring. In the absence of these findings biochemical determinations are necessary. The most important of these are the serum ceruloplasmin, the urinary copper, and the hepatic copper concentration on biopsy. Treatment consists in the administration of the copper chelating agent, penicillamine, and the avoidance of a high copper intake. This usually results in marked clinical improvement if irreversible tissue damage has not occurred. Maintenance therapy for life is necessary in order to continue the negative copper balance. The detection and prophylactic treatment of asymptomatic individuals with the disease is especially important. Seven cases of Wilson's disease have been presented in order to illustrate many of the features which have been discussed, with emphasis on the ocular findings.",1976,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

866569,Pregnancy in Wilson's disease.,J M Walshe,"The effect of pregnancy has been studied in 10 mothers with Wilson's disease. Three were presymptomatic but had the typical biochemical lesion, two of these were receiving penicillamine treatment at the time of conception, the third had yet to be diagnosed. The remaining seven mothers had had symptoms of Wilson's disease and had been receiving treatment for periods ranging from two and a half to 19 years. These mothers had 15 pregnancies between them, 13 went to full term but two ended prematurely at 26 and 30 weeks. In only one did pregnancy have an unfavourable effect on the Wilson's disease; this mother had been on penicillamine for only two and a half years in a suboptimal dose because of drug induced thrombocytopoenia. In addition she had extensive oesophageal varices and pregnancy was complicated by toxaemia. The other nine patients remained well and two had three pregnancies each. On six occasions penicillamine was taken throughout pregnancy, but in seven it was discontinued from the sixth to the twelfth week. All 15 babies were normal but one died of extreme prematurity (26 weeks gestation). Pregnancy does not appear to be contraindicated in well treated Wilson's disease and penicillamine does not seem to pose an undue risk to the foetus.",1977,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
875462,The ophthalmologic manifestations of Wilson's disease.,"D O Wiebers, R W Hollenhorst, N P Goldstein","Fifty-three patients with Wilson's disease were studied with regard to ophthalmologic abnormalities. Of the 35 symptomatic patients initially seen and treated at the Mayo Clinic, 34 (97%) had Kayser-Fleischer rings and 6 (17%) had sunflower cataracts at the time of diagnosis. In patients followed for a year or more, penicillamine therapy resulted in improvement of the Kayser-Fleischer rings in 18 of 20 (90%) patients and total clearing of the sunflower cataracts in 4 of 5 patients. The specific pattern of copper deposition in Kayser-Fleischer rings and the improvement with treatment occurred along four reproducible stages. None of five asymptomatic siblings of patients with known Wilson's disease had Kayer-Fleischer rings at the time of initial study. In one (untreated) of the five, Kayser-Fleischer rings developed 20 months after the initial normal slit-lamp examination. The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and the absence of other ophthalmologic signs (such as nystagmus, cranial nerve palsies, and other movement disorders), can be of great assistance in the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. Once the condition has been diagnosed, specific medical therapy with penicillamine and low-copper diet dramatically improves what would otherwise be an inevitably fatal course.",1977,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
715173,"The urinary excretion of radiocopper in presymptomatic and symptomatic Wilson's disease, heterozygotes and controls: its significance in diagnosis and management.","K Gibbs, R Hanka, J M Walshe","Radiocopper (64Cu, 67CU), given intravenously, has been used to study the pattern of excretion of copper in patients with presymptomatic, symptomatic and treated Wilson's disease, together with heterozygotes for the Wilson's disease gene and a control group of patients with a variety of neurological lesions mimicking Wilson's disease. Urine was collected for three periods after injection, 0 to 8 hours, 8 to 24 hours, at which time a test dose of penicillamine was given, and from 24 to 30 hours. Stable (endogenous) copper was also estimated on these samples and specific activity was determined. This was multiplied by a correction factor to allow for variations in dose and body weight. The findings for stable copper in urine were largely predictable. Controls and heterozygotes had the least copper excretion, the amounts rising in the presymptomatic to a peak in the symptomatic patients. Institution of therapy was associated with a fall in copper excretion pro rata with time. The most important radiochemical findings were as follows. Heterozygotes excreted less of the injected copper than controls both under basal conditions and after penicillamine. Presymptomatic patients excreted less radiocopper than heterozygotes after penicillamine although the excretion during the basal 24 hour period was very much greater. Patients with symptomatic Wilson's disease had by far the highest excretion of radiocopper in all three time periods which fell after treatment, pro rata with time, as had been found for stable copper. These results were subjected to computer analysis. There was no overlap between the various groups with the exception of a single control subject who had combined pyramidal and extrapyramidal system degeneration of obscure aetiology. This patient was classified by the computer study as 'heterozygote'. These findings lend further support to the hypothesis that the loss of a single gene for copper balance can be detected with a high degree of accuracy and also that presymptomatic patients can be selected from a sibship for prophylactic treatment without the risk of subjecting healthy heterozygotes to unnecessary and potentially hazardous long-term therapy.",1978,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

Heretofore, many clinicians felt that the development of deficiency states was not likely except in very extreme conditions because the presence of trace elements in nature was so ubiquitous. The increased use of total parenteral nutrition seems to have made this viewpoint untenable. The recognition of additional genetic diseases of trace element metabolism such as Menkes' kinky hair syndrome and acrodermatitis enteropathica has also served to focus clinical attention on trace elements. As time passes, no doubt, additional diseases of trace element metabolism will be recognized.",1979,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

The classical triad of Kayser-Fleischer rings, neurologic dysfunction, and hypoceruloplasminemia may be absent. Patients may be seen initially with acute or chronic hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, or neurologic dysfunction. Guidelines are presented for diagnosis of Wilson's disease based on a review of 25 pediatric and adolescent patients. A high index of suspicion in necessary so that therapy with penicillamine may be begun before irreversible liver or neurologic damage occurs. The prognosis is excellent when diagnosis and treatment are established early.",1978,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
930749,Failure of L-dopa to relieve activated rigidity in Parkinson's disease.,"D D Webster, J A Mortimer","Rigidity in Parkinson patients can be easily quantitated by determining net work required to passively flex and extend the forearm through an arc of 100 degrees. Rigidity thus measured can be subdivided into two very distinct types, resting and activated. Resting rigidity, measured while the patient is relaxed, responds to all effective therapeutic agents and correlates closely to degree of clinical improvement. Activated rigidity, measured during voluntary activity, is not relieved by any presently available medical treatment. It remains unchanged at pre-therapy levels even in patients who may temporarily appear to have dramatic improvement in clinical symptomatology. Longitudinal measurements made in hundreds of parkinson patients over intervals ranging from 5 to 15 years show continuing high levels of activated rigidity through the entire period of study. In marked contrast to our wide experience with parkinson patients is a single, well documented case of Wilson's disease who appears to have recovered completely both by clinical examination and by all of our machine measurements. This patient had high levels of extrapyramidal deficit, repeatedly measured over a period of four months when penicillamine therapy was being investigated. He then suddenly reverted to normal and returned to full time employment. High values of resting rigidity activated rigidity, akinesia and resting tremor all reverted to normal and have remained normal for the past 6 years. The implication of this study is that L-dopa and related treatments only mask the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease and are not retarding the underlying pathological process. Penicillamine, on the other hand, probably does relieve the destructive process in Wilson's disease and may in early cases, permanently relieve the extrapyramidal dysfunction.",1977,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0
917352,Primary and secondary disturbances in trace element metabolism connected with genetic metabolic disorders.,"I Lombeck, H J Bremer","Several primarily inherited disturbances of minerals and trace elements have been discovered within the last 20 years. Secondary disturbances of selenium and zinc induced by dietetic treatment of inborn errors of metabolism and by parenteral nutrition also came to our knowledge recently. Two main types of chronic or primary hypomagnesaemia are known which are caused either by impaired intestinal absorption or by false magnesium handling by the kidneys. In acrodermatitis enteropathica, an autosomal-recessive inherited disease leading to characteristic skin lesions, alopecia and dystrophy, low zinc concentrations of serum, urine and hair are measured. The intestinal absorption of zinc is reduced. In copper metabolism two inherited diseases are known with low serum and usually caerulosplasmin concentrations. In Menkes' steely hair syndrome (trichlpoliodystrophy) an intestinal net malabsorption of copper exists, whereas in Wilson's disease the copper contents of several organs are increased.",1977,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

This was accompanied by acute renal failure. In the absence of renal function sufficient for the urinary excretion of penicillamine, studies were performed to assess the potential of peritoneal dialysis, ascites removal by ultrafiltration-reinfusion, and haemodialysis as alternative excretory pathways for copper. The greatest amount of copper, as judged by rising bath concentrations, seemed to be eliminated with haemodialysis. But this was accompanied by a progressive increase in serum copper concentrations with rapid clinical and biochemical deterioration leading to death within 48 hours. A small amount of copper was lost with ascites removal. Significant amounts of copper were removed during peritoneal dialysis (36 mumol/day (2287 microgram/day)), although a clinical response was not evident before haemodialysis was introduced. The administration of penicillamine orally, intravenously, or intraperitoneally produced no measurable increase in copper excretion into the peritoneal dialysate. Hence peritoneal dialysis alone appears to offer the greatest potential benefit with regard to both eliminating copper and altering the course of this fulminant form of Wilson's disease.",1977,Appenzeller-Herzog_2019,0

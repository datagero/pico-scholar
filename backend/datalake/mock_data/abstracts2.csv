16625678,Enhanced activity and selectivity in cyclohexane autoxidation by inert H-bond acceptor catalysts.,"Ive Hermans, Jozef Peeters, Pierre A Jacobs","Herein, we demonstrate that the chain-initiating dissociation of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, CyOOH, is substantially accelerated by H-bond acceptors (e.g. Teflon), which assist O-O bond breaking by stabilising the leaving *OH radical. This is a completely new approach to boost the chain-propagating radical concentration. Indeed, up to now, literature has remained focussed on transition metal catalysis. In addition to this initiation effect, we demonstrate how inert perfluorinated compounds are also able to steer the selectivity at the molecular level, by promoting the conversion of the intermediate cyclohexyl hydroperoxide to the most desired end-product, cyclohexanone. This effect is explained by an enhanced, H-bond-assisted, hydroperoxide propagation. This hitherto overlooked hydroperoxide propagation was recently presented by us as the dominant cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol source. We herein thus confirm our previously reported autoxidation scheme, and illustrate its usefulness as a solid basis for designing new catalytic systems.",2006
16625679,Uncalibrated modelling of conservative tracer and pesticide leaching to groundwater: comparison of potential Tier II exposure assessment models.,"Garey A Fox, George J Sabbagh, Wenlin Chen, Mark H Russell","The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM) are currently being considered by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) for Tier II screening of pesticide leaching to groundwater (November 2005). The objective of the present research was to compare RZWQM and PRZM based on observed conservative tracer and pesticide pore water and soil concentrations collected in two unique groundwater leaching studies in North Carolina and Georgia. These two sites had been used previously by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Environmental Model Validation Task Force (EMVTF) in the validation of PRZM. As in the FIFRA EMVTF PRZM validation, 'cold' modelling using input parameters based on EPA guidelines/databases and 'site-specific' modelling using field-measured soil and hydraulic parameters were performed with a recently released version of RZWQM called RZWQM-NAWQA (National Water Quality Assessment). Model calibration was not performed for either the 'cold' or 'site-specific' modelling. The models were compared based on predicted pore water and soil concentrations of bromide and pesticides throughout the soil profile. Both models tended to predict faster movement through the soil profile than observed. Based on a quantitative normalised objective function (NOF), RZWQM-NAWQA generally outperformed or was equivalent to PRZM in simulating pore water and soil concentrations. Both models were more successful in predicting soil concentrations (i.e. NOF < 1.0 for site-specific data, which satisfies site-specific applicability) than they were at predicting pore water concentrations.",2006
16625680,Plant-derived natural products exhibiting activity against formosan subterranean termites (Coptotermes formosanus).,"Kumudini M Meepagala, Weste Osbrink, George Sturtz, Alan Lax","The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, is among the most devastating termite pests. Natural products derived from plant extracts were tested in a discovery programme for effective, environmentally friendly termite control agents. Among the natural products tested, vulgarone B (isolated from Artemisia douglasiana Besser), apiol (isolated from Ligusticum hultenii (Fern.) Calder & Taylor) and cnicin (isolated from Centaurea maculosa Lam.) exhibited significantly higher mortalities than in untreated controls in laboratory bioassay. These compounds are present at high levels in their respective plant sources and also possess other biological activities such as phytotoxic and antifungal properties.",2006
16625928,Enhanced surface-plasmon resonance absorption in metal-dielectric-metal layered microspheres.,"Keisuke Hasegawa, Charles Rohde, Miriam Deutsch","We present a theoretical study of the dispersion relation of surface-plasmon resonances of mesoscopic metal-dielectric-metal microspheres. By analyzing the solutions to Maxwell's equations, we obtain a simple geometric condition for which the system exhibits a band of surface-plasmon modes whose resonant frequencies are weakly dependent on the multipole number. Using a modified Mie calculation, we find that a large number of modes belonging to this flat-dispersion band can be excited simultaneously by a plane wave, thus enhancing the absorption cross section. We demonstrate that the enhanced absorption peak of the sphere is geometrically tunable over the entire visible range.",2006
16625929,Ultraviolet laser filaments for remote laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analysis: applications in cultural heritage monitoring.,"Stelios Tzortzakis, Demetrios Anglos, David Gray","We report experiments with subpicosecond UV laser filaments for the remote analysis of samples related to objects of cultural heritage. The classic laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique finds new avenues through femtosecond filamentation, and dynamic remote LIBS becomes possible. Advantages such as self-regulated laser intensity deposition on the target suggest that there is significant potential for using UV femtosecond filaments for the remote analysis of sculpture and large monuments.",2006
16625930,Measurement of surface concentration of fluorophores by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy.,"A Delon, J Derouard, G Delapierre, R Jaffiol","Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy is applied to study molecules passing through a small observation volume, usually subjected to diffusive or convective motion in a liquid phase. We suggest that such a technique could be used to measure the areal absolute concentration of fluorophores deposited on a substrate or embedded in a thin film, with a resolution of a few micrometers. The principle is to translate the solid substrate in front of a confocal fluorescence microscope objective and to record the subsequent fluctuations of the fluorescence intensity. The validity of this concept is investigated on model substrates (fluorescent microspheres) and DNA biochips.",2006
16625931,High-repetition-rate 12 fs pulse amplification by a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier system.,"Hideyuki Takada, Masayuki Kakehata, Kenji Torizuka",We demonstrate the direct generation of 12 fs pulses from a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier system at a 1 kHz repetition rate utilizing properly designed broadband components for chirped-pulse amplification. Optimized designs of a regenerative amplifier with a multilayer gain-narrowing compensator and an adaptive dispersion compensator with a spatial light modulator contribute to the shorter pulse amplification.,2006
16625932,Multimilliwatt ultrashort pulses continuously tunable in the visible from a compact fiber source.,"K Moutzouris, E Adler, F Sotier, D TrÃ¤utlein, A Leitenstorfer","We report on a single-pass device that efficiently converts the broadband near-infrared output from a femtosecond fiber laser into a narrow spectrum in the visible. With fan-out poled MgO:LiNbO3 we obtain sub-picosecond, continuously tunable pulses in the 520-700 nm range. Conversion efficiencies as high as 30% are observed at typical pump power levels of 30 mW, corresponding to average output powers up to 9.5 mW. The specifications of our device are ideal for applications in confocal microscopy and frequency metrology.",2006
16625933,Heterodyne spectral interferometry for multidimensional nonlinear spectroscopy of individual quantum systems.,"Wolfgang Langbein, Brian Patton","A novel implementation of transient nonlinear spectroscopy is presented that allows the study of the transient nonlinear polarization emitted from individual electronic transitions. Both the amplitude and the phase of the polarization are retrieved, permitting the implementation of multidimensional spectroscopy in the excitation pulse delays. The technique is shown to detect mutual coherent coupling in a group of individual, localized excitonic transitions.",2006
16625934,In situ broadband pulse compression for multiphoton microscopy using a shaper-assisted collinear SPIDER.,"Bernhard von Vacano, Tiago Buckup, Marcus Motzkus",The characterization and control of the phase of broadband femtosecond pulses in nonlinear microscopy are successfully demonstrated with a collinear configuration of spectral shear interferometry for direct electric field reconstruction (SPIDER). A femtosecond-pulse shaper is used as a dispersionless interferometer for the measurement of the spectral phase and to actively compress a broadband supercontinuum from a photonic crystal fiber. This allows in situ online phase management and enables the application of quantum control spectroscopy in microenvironments.,2006
16625935,High-repetition-rate white-light pump-probe spectroscopy with a tapered fiber.,"M Punke, F Hoos, C Karnutsch, U Lemmer, N Linder, K Streubel","We have realized a 76 MHz white-light differential transmission spectroscopy system. The technique employs a Ti:sapphire laser oscillator and a tapered fiber to generate a white-light continuum spanning almost the full visible to near-infrared spectral range. Using acousto-optical modulation and subsequent lock-in detection, transient relative transmission changes as small as 10(-5) are detected. The method is applied to study the ultrafast gain dynamics of the active layer of a vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting laser based on a multiple-quantum-well structure.",2006
16625936,"Neighborhood deterioration, social skills, and social relationships in late life.",Neal Krause,"This study is designed to test two hypotheses. The first specifies that older adults who live in dilapidated neighborhoods will receive less social support and encounter more negative interaction with family and friends. The second hypothesis proposes that the relationship between deteriorated neighborhood conditions and social relationships will depend upon whether older study participants have strong social skills. Data from a recent nationwide survey of older adults suggest that living in run-down neighborhoods is associated with more negative interaction; however, residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods is not related to the amount of support older people receive from significant others. But perhaps more important, the findings further reveal that the effects of living in run-down neighborhoods on social support and negative interaction are completely offset for older individuals who possess strong social skills.",2006
16625937,Cognitive abilities of Alzheimer's patients: perceptions of Black and White caregivers.,"Robert Burns, Linda O Nichols, Marshall J Graney, Jennifer Martindale-Adams, Allan Lummus","This study compared Black (n = 97) and White (n = 143) family caregivers regarding the relationship between subjective and objective cognitive assessments of Alzheimer's patients from the Memphis site of the NIA/NINR Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregivers Health (REACH) randomized clinical trial. Black and White caregivers' subjective ratings (Pearlin Cognitive Status Scale) of their care recipients' cognitive abilities were equivalent, but White Alzheimer's patients had higher objective cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination). In simple regression analysis, race was significantly related to differences between subjective and objective cognitive assessments and remained so when caregiver age, sex, income, education, relationship to care recipient, caregiver bother (burden), and care recipient sex were statistically controlled in multiple regression analysis. Compared to the other group, Black caregivers generally overrated, and White caregivers underrated, their care recipient's cognitive ability. This difference in caregiver's appraisal may affect clinical and behavioral interventions for dementia patients and their caregivers.",2006
16625938,Physiological reactivity to cognitive stressors: variations by age and socioeconomic status.,"Shevaun D Neupert, Lisa M Soederberg Miller, Margie E Lachman","The present study focused on age and SES differences in stress reactivity in response to cognitively challenging tasks. Specifically, we assessed within-person trajectories of cortisol, a steroid hormone released by the adrenal gland in response to stressors, before, during, and after exposure to cognitively challenging tasks. We extend the current literature by simultaneously examining age and SES differences in physiological reactivity. Findings suggest that age and SES both play an important role in reactivity, such that it was the older adults with higher SES who were the most physiologically reactive to cognitive stressors. Implications of these findings for cognitive aging research are discussed.",2006
16625939,Bringing the law to the gerontological stage: a different look at movies and old age.,Israel Doron,"Films often portray the complexities of real-life aging issues, showing how they are apparently handled outside of and around the law or legal issues. Furthermore, films considering the aged and the social issues associated with aging also reveal how the law actually functions as a framework around and within which people develop customs, habits, and behaviors related to the issue of old age. Exposing these hidden socio-legal boundaries allows us to better understand both the films concerned and the place of law within our aging society. In an attempt to better understand these issues, this article deconstructs five relatively modern and well-known films. All feature aged protagonists, and all tell their stories against a background of legal issues that are only alluded to, and remain hidden ""behind the scenes."" Two main questions are addressed by this analysis: First, to what extent does the reality of old age as described in the films considered here reflect familiar social phenomena identified by empirical studies? And, second, to what extent does the legal infrastructure embedded in the narrative of these films reflect the legal regulations that govern the aged in today's society. The conclusions that arose from the analysis of the cinematic and the legal reality expressed in the films demonstrate that the current level of discourse on major issues in social gerontology ignores the importance and relevance of law. Therefore, it behooves us to ""bring the Law to the gerontological stage,"" where the current situation as it actually exists can be analyzed and perhaps even changed.",2006
16625940,"Understanding associations of control beliefs, social relations, and well-being in older adults with osteoarthritis.","Vanessa M Ferreira, Aurora M Sherman","Control beliefs and social relationships have been individually assessed in relation to adaptation to chronic illness, although only rarely together. Further, some control scales show psychometric limitations in older adult samples. To address these concerns, a scale assessing external control was created by factor analyzing the items from Levenson's (1974) control subscales. We tested the association of external control beliefs, measured with the new formulation of items, and two social relations variables (support and strain) to well-being measures in a sample of older adults reporting osteoarthritis (OA; N = 95, 72% female). We also compared the new formulation of items to the original subscales. The Levenson measures were significantly related to life satisfaction after controlling for social relations. However, the new externality scale was a stronger correlate than the chance subscale (though not different from powerful others). Only the new scale was related to depressive symptoms once social relations were controlled. In addition, social support was significantly associated with both outcomes.",2006
16625941,Possibilities for fertility restoration: a new surgical technique.,"Krishen Sieunarine, Faris B P Zakaria, Deborah C M Boyle, David J Corless, David E Noakes, Iain Lindsay, Andrew Lawson, Laszlo Ungar, Giuseppe Del Priores, J Richard Smith","Previously published work concluded that uterine artery microvascular anastomosis in the porcine model was feasible with subsequent normal vascular function in pregnancy. of the anastomosed vessels. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of uterine autotransplantation in a porcine model using microvascular anastomoses. Eight large white/landrace sows of proven fertility were used. A supracervical hysterectomy with or without bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) was performed. After 1 hour of cold storage in a transplant solution, the specimen was reintroduced and followed by stepwise vascular reanastomosis. Objective perfusion index measurements suggested adequate uterine perfusion after transplantation. Postoperatively, sow 1 survived to 3 months with no signs of oestrus, and sows 2, 6, and 8 were killed on days 6, 33, and 54, respectively, for pelvic infection. Histopathology of the uterine grafts revealed gradual vessel thromboses. Microvascular reanastomosis is feasible, however, unsuccessful in uterine autotransplantation because of gradual vessel thromboses. The porcine model is highly susceptible to postoperative infection.",2005
16625942,Is it feasible to use a large vessel patch with a uterine allograft en bloc for uterine transplantation?,"Krishen Sieunarine, Nadey S Hakim, David J Corless, David E Noakes, Laszlo Ungar, Giuseppe Del Priore, J Richard Smith","Uterine auto-transplantation in the porcine model using a microvascular anastomotic technique failed because of gradual vessel thromboses. A macrovascular patch harvest with the uterus en bloc is probably less likely to undergo vessel thrombosis. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of an aortic/inferior vena caval vascular patch harvest with the uterus en bloc for uterine cross-transplantation purposes. A preserved human cadaver and freshly killed porcine and rabbit cadaveric models were used. The infrarenal aorta, inferior vena cava, common and internal iliac vessels and the uterine arterial and venous tree together with the uterus en bloc were successfully harvested intact as a large vessel patch and graft in both animal and human models. A macrovascular patch for uterine cross-transplantation is technically easy and feasible to harvest en bloc with the uterus in fresh cadaveric donors. This technique precludes live donors and makes cadaveric organ donation essential.",2005
16625943,Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava: a case report and review of literature.,"Vinaykumar B Thapar, Rajeev R Satoskar, Geeta M Kanjan, Apurva S Chaudhary","Tumors of the inferior vena cava are rare, and most of these are leiomyosarcomas. They are most frequent in the sixth decade of life, with a female predominance. We present a 45-year-old male patient with a tumor involving the entire extent of the inferior vena cava. Computerized tomography revealed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with marked expansion of the inferior vena cava with extraluminal extension. Computerized tomography--guided biopsy of the extraluminal component showed features of a fasciculated spindle cell tumor positive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and calponin and negative for S-100 antigen. We discuss the clinical presentation imaging findings and review the literature.",2005

The purpose of this study was to assess the results of anatomic liver resection for severe liver trauma in the institution in which liver transplant surgeons are responsible for the management of liver injuries.",2005
16625946,Extra-adrenal nonfunctional retroperitoneal paraganglioma: case report and review of the literature.,"Gheorghe Ghidirim, Gheorghe Rojnoveanu, Igor Mishin, Eugen Gutsu, Iraida Iakovleva","An extra-adrenal paraganglioma is a rare tumor derived from the chromaffin cells of sympathetic ganglia. This report documents a rare case of nonfunctional extra-adrenal paraganglioma in a 20-year-old woman with persistent flank pain. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a solid mass with calcification in center, measuring 7 x 6 x 6 cm, and localized in the left upper para-aortal retroperitoneal region. Absence of typical clinical symptoms made a correct preoperative diagnosis unlikely. Tumor was successfully removed through a midline laparotomy incision, and pathological analysis of the surgical specimen revealed a paraganglioma. After 12 months, the patient is still in a good health, asymptomatic, and without evidence of tumor recurrence. This case emphasizes the necessity to include extra-adrenal paraganglioma in the differential diagnosis and management of retroperitoneal tumors, despite its rarity.",2005

Between January 1998 and September 2002, a total of 16 patients with recurrent palmar hyperhidrosis underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic T2 and T3 sympathetic block. There were seven men and nine women, with a mean age of 21.1 years (range, 12-35 years). All patients were placed in a semi-sitting position under single-lumen intubated anesthesia. We performed the T2 sympathetic block for patients with still intact T2 ganglion using an 8-mm, 0 degrees thoracoscope. An additional T3 block should be given if patients received either previous T2 sympathectomy or elevated palmar temperature <1 degrees C after T2 sympathetic block. The mean operation time was 30 minutes. The level of sympathetic blocks were the T2 and T3 in five patients, only T2 block in four, patients, and only T3 block in seven patients. Improvement of palmar hyperhidrosis can be obtained in all patients. One patient received a reverse operation 12 days after the T2 and T3 clipping and obtained improvement of troublesome compensatory sweating and dry hands 1 day after removal of all clips. All patients obtained improvement of palmar hyperhidrosis without recurrence after a mean of 37.1 months of follow-up (range, 12-56 months). Endoscopic thoracic T2 with or without T3 sympathetic block by clipping is a safe and effective method in treating patients with recurrent palmar hyperhidrosis.",2005
16625955,Chronic headache.,Steven B Graff-Radford,,2006
16625956,Cerviogenic headache.,Steven D Bender,"Cervicogenic headache has historically been misdiagnosed, ultimately leading to misguided therapies. Even with the growing body of literature in the field of headache, this particular entity is still vastly understudied. Efforts should be made to encourage appropriate clinical studies in order to provide evidence based therapeutic modalities for this patient population. The dental professional is provided with the unique opportunity to see these patients on a regular basis without the time constraints now shouldered by our physician colleagues. The goal of any health care provider should be to provide the most comprehensive, multi-modal and/or multidisciplinary care possible in our field of expertise. Expanding our practice model to include a more comprehensive approach to patient care has the potential to not only help an underserved population of pain patients but also provide the practitioner with the reward of heartfelt gratitude when pain relief is provided.",2006
16625945,Carcinoid tumor of the thymus: a clinicopathologic report of two cases with a review of the literature.,"Shi-Ping Luh, Chih Kuo, Wen-Shan Liu, Tzu-Chin Wu, Chiew-Loon Koo, Jia-Yuh Chen","Thymic carcinoid, a tumor with neuroendocrine-derived cells, is extremely rare. Its clinical and pathological features are distinct from other thymic tumors or carcinoids in other organs. The prognosis is poorer compared with other thymic tumors. Herein, we describe two cases with thymic carcinoids that were completely resected and underwent radiotherapy after surgery. The postoperative follow-up periods were 7 years and 7 months. These rare cases are discussed in light of the clinico-pathological picture of thymic carcinoid reported in the literature.",2005

16625678,Enhanced activity and selectivity in cyclohexane autoxidation by inert H-bond acceptor catalysts.,"Ive Hermans, Jozef Peeters, Pierre A Jacobs","Herein, we demonstrate that the chain-initiating dissociation of cyclohexyl hydroperoxide, CyOOH, is substantially accelerated by H-bond acceptors (e.g. Teflon), which assist O-O bond breaking by stabilising the leaving *OH radical. This is a completely new approach to boost the chain-propagating radical concentration. Indeed, up to now, literature has remained focussed on transition metal catalysis. In addition to this initiation effect, we demonstrate how inert perfluorinated compounds are also able to steer the selectivity at the molecular level, by promoting the conversion of the intermediate cyclohexyl hydroperoxide to the most desired end-product, cyclohexanone. This effect is explained by an enhanced, H-bond-assisted, hydroperoxide propagation. This hitherto overlooked hydroperoxide propagation was recently presented by us as the dominant cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol source. We herein thus confirm our previously reported autoxidation scheme, and illustrate its usefulness as a solid basis for designing new catalytic systems.",2006
16625679,Uncalibrated modelling of conservative tracer and pesticide leaching to groundwater: comparison of potential Tier II exposure assessment models.,"Garey A Fox, George J Sabbagh, Wenlin Chen, Mark H Russell","The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM) are currently being considered by the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) in the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) for Tier II screening of pesticide leaching to groundwater (November 2005). The objective of the present research was to compare RZWQM and PRZM based on observed conservative tracer and pesticide pore water and soil concentrations collected in two unique groundwater leaching studies in North Carolina and Georgia. These two sites had been used previously by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) Environmental Model Validation Task Force (EMVTF) in the validation of PRZM. As in the FIFRA EMVTF PRZM validation, 'cold' modelling using input parameters based on EPA guidelines/databases and 'site-specific' modelling using field-measured soil and hydraulic parameters were performed with a recently released version of RZWQM called RZWQM-NAWQA (National Water Quality Assessment). Model calibration was not performed for either the 'cold' or 'site-specific' modelling. The models were compared based on predicted pore water and soil concentrations of bromide and pesticides throughout the soil profile. Both models tended to predict faster movement through the soil profile than observed. Based on a quantitative normalised objective function (NOF), RZWQM-NAWQA generally outperformed or was equivalent to PRZM in simulating pore water and soil concentrations. Both models were more successful in predicting soil concentrations (i.e. NOF < 1.0 for site-specific data, which satisfies site-specific applicability) than they were at predicting pore water concentrations.",2006
16625680,Plant-derived natural products exhibiting activity against formosan subterranean termites (Coptotermes formosanus).,"Kumudini M Meepagala, Weste Osbrink, George Sturtz, Alan Lax","The Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, is among the most devastating termite pests. Natural products derived from plant extracts were tested in a discovery programme for effective, environmentally friendly termite control agents. Among the natural products tested, vulgarone B (isolated from Artemisia douglasiana Besser), apiol (isolated from Ligusticum hultenii (Fern.) Calder & Taylor) and cnicin (isolated from Centaurea maculosa Lam.) exhibited significantly higher mortalities than in untreated controls in laboratory bioassay. These compounds are present at high levels in their respective plant sources and also possess other biological activities such as phytotoxic and antifungal properties.",2006

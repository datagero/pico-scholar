Varying the coverage of CO or the coadsorbed atom proved to have a profound effect on the strength of the interaction energy. The general trend, however, is the same in all cases: the interaction energy becomes more repulsive when moving towards the right along a row of elements, and reaches a maximum somewhere in the middle of a row of elements. The absolute value of the interaction energy between an atom-CO pair ranges from about -0.40 eV (39 kJ mol(-1)) attraction to +0.70 eV (68 kJ mol(-1)) repulsion, depending on the coadsorbate, the metal and the coverage. The general trend in interaction energies seems to be a common characteristic for several transition metals.",2006
